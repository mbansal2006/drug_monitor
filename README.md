This project analyzes the **geographic and geopolitical risk exposure** of pharmaceuticals for **finished dosage forms (FDFs)** of all FDA-approved drug products to support visibility, accountability, and resilience in U.S. drug supply chains. This dataset does not yet include BLA-regulated biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies).

This project focuses on finished dosage forms (FDFs). API-level risk scoring is possible using the same methodology, pending expanded metadata.

## Project Overview

By mapping where drugs are manufactured, identifying regulatory or geopolitical red flags, and quantifying national security dependencies, the tool offers a data-driven foundation for:

- Supply chain risk management  
- Shortage prevention and monitoring  
- Domestic capacity planning  
- Strategic sourcing evaluations

All scoring and site data are derived from U.S. government and intergovernmental sources, including the FDA, GSA, BIS, OFAC, the U.S. State Department, NATO, and the OECD. The system updates weekly. However, note that many data sources such as openFDA are updated infrequently such as on a quarterly basis.

Built with Palantir Foundry, the model is fully queryable in all directionsâ€”allowing seamless tracing from drugs to manufacturers to global production sites and back, enabling comprehensive, multidimensional analysis of the supply chain. Users can filter and pivot across any dimension in Palantir Foundry (e.g., by drug class, country risk, or manufacturer).

This project is modeled in both Palantir Foundry and a Ruby on Rails web application. The Rails app loads structured datasets from CSV files into a PostgreSQL database and defines ActiveRecord models with full associations between drugs, manufacturers, NDCs, and manufacturing locations. It supports custom Rake tasks for CSV import, a fully normalized schema, and is designed for extensibility in frontend views (e.g. search, filter, and relationship maps).

All data is sourced from official U.S. government systems to ensure transparency, reliability, and regulatory consistency across the supply chain ontology.

### Key Capabilities

- Determine where finished dosage forms (FDFs) are manufactured globally 
- Quantify national security risk using geographic, regulatory, and geopolitical indicators tied to pharmaceutical production  
- Identify drugs most exposed to fragile or adversarial production networks  
- Support strategies to prioritize domestic or allied sourcing of essential medicines through targeted risk insights  
- Deliver actionable insights to inform policy discussions, such as Section 232 investigations, by quantifying foreign dependency and national security exposure in the pharmaceutical supply chain

### Abridged Example: Linking an NDC to Drug, Manufacturer, and Location

Below is a real-world example showing how a single drug product (represented by an NDC) is connected to its drug classification, manufacturer, and a physical production location. This demonstrates how the database links structured fields across models.

Each row represents an object from a different table. The `id` columns (e.g. `ndc_id`, `drug_id`) are internal reference numbers used within the database to link related entries. These are not publicly meaningful but allow us to relate records to each other consistently.

## Risk Score Methodology

Each `Location` is assigned a `risk_score` from **0 (high risk)** to **10 (low risk)**. Scores are additive and clamped to this range, using a structured system grounded entirely in **U.S. government data** with the exception of member lists such as NATO or OECD. The model accounts for alliance status, export behavior, sanctions, quality compliance, and trade law alignment.

Scores are computed in Palantir Foundry and Python using national-level mappings, then joined to locations via country codes.

### Positive Criteria: Strategic Alignment & Compliance

> If a country is not TAA compliant, an additional -1 penalty is applied regardless of other affiliations.

### Risk Score Calculation Logic

- Start from a **neutral base score of 5**
- Apply all applicable bonuses and penalties
- Clamp the final result between **0 (minimum risk)** and **10 (maximum risk)**

All criteria are applied using boolean flags such as:

- `is_five_eyes`, `is_nato`, `is_mnna`, `is_oecd`, `is_quad`, `taa_compliant`
- `has_bis_ns1`, `has_bis_rs1`, `ofac_sanctioned`, `has_export_ban_history`, `engages_in_dumping`, `quality_risk_flag`

### Example Scoring Flow

#### India (`IND`)

| Attribute                         | Value   | Score Change           |
|----------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| QUAD Member                      | Yes     | +1                       |
| TAA Compliant                    | No      | -1                       |
| BIS NS1 Listed                   | Yes     | -2                       |
| Export Ban History               | Yes     | -2                       |
| FDA OAI Risk Flag (>5%)         | Yes     | -2                       |
| Total Score                      |          | 5 + 1 - 7 = -1           |
| Final Risk Score (clamped)      |          | 0                        |

India receives no alliance benefits and is penalized for NS1 classification, export restrictions, and an above-average FDA inspection failure rateâ€”placing it in the highest risk category.

#### United Kingdom (`GBR`)

| Attribute                         | Value   | Score Change           |
|----------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Five Eyes Member                 | Yes     | +2                       |
| NATO Member                      | Yes     | +1                       |
| OECD Member                      | Yes     | +1                       |
| TAA Compliant                    | Yes     | +1                       |
| Total Score                      |          | 5 + 5 = 10            |
| Final Risk Score (clamped)      |          | 10                        |

The UK ranks as a low-risk partner due to its extensive alliance memberships and trade compliance, with only a minor deduction for BIS NS1 classification.

## Next Steps / Development Roadmap

- Expand FDA inspection data to site-level OAI trends  
- Add more granular geographic intelligence (e.g., city-level export chokepoints)  
- Integrate DailyMed and Structured Product Label (SPL) metadata  
- Build policy dashboard overlay for real-time shortage triage  
- Add additional drugs and products beyond the FDA Drug Shortages Database  
- Fill in missing manufacturing location data using non-FDA government sources and public SPL XMLs
