                  <paragraph>Leucovorin is a mixture of the diastereoisomers of the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). The biologically active compound of the mixture is the (-)-<content styleCode="italics">l</content>-isomer, known as Citrovorum factor, or (-)-folinic acid. Leucovorin does not require reduction by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in order to participate in reactions utilizing folates as a source of “one-carbon” moieties. <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-Leucovorin (<content styleCode="italics">l</content>-5-formyltetrahydrofolate) is rapidly metabolized (via 5, 10-methenyltetrahydrofolate then 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) to <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-5-methyltetrahydrofolate. <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate can in turn be metabolized via other pathways back to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by an irreversible, enzyme catalyzed reduction using the cofactors FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADPH.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Administration of leucovorin can counteract the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In contrast, leucovorin can enhance the therapeutic and toxic effects of fluoropyrimidines used in cancer therapy, such as 5-fluorouracil. Concurrent administration of leucovorin does not appear to alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of 5-fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is metabolized to fluorodeoxyuridylic acid, which binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (an enzyme important in DNA repair and replication).

                  <paragraph>Leucovorin is readily converted to another reduced folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of fluorodeoxyuridylic acid to thymidylate synthase and thereby enhances the inhibition of this enzyme.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intramuscular, and oral administration of a 25 mg dose of leucovorin were studied in male volunteers. After intravenous administration, serum total reduced folates (as measured by <content styleCode="italics">Lactobacillus casei</content> assay) reached a mean peak of 1,259 ng/mL (range 897 to 1,625). The mean time to peak was 10 minutes. This initial rise in total reduced folates was primarily due to the parent compound 5-formyl-THF (measured by <content styleCode="italics">Streptococcus faecalis</content> assay) which rose to 1,206 ng/mL at 10 minutes. A sharp drop in parent compound followed and coincided with the appearance of the active metabolite 5-methyl-THF which became the predominant circulating form of the drug.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mean peak of 5-methyl-THF was 258 ng/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours. The terminal half-life for total reduced folates was 6.2 hours. The area under the concentration versus time curves (AUCs) for <content styleCode="italics">l-</content>leucovorin, <content styleCode="italics">d</content>-leucovorin and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate were 28.4 ± 3.5, 956 ± 97 and 129 ± 12 (mg/min/L ± S.E.). When a higher dose of <content styleCode="italics">d,l</content>-leucovorin (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was used, similar results were obtained. The <content styleCode="italics">d</content>-isomer persisted in plasma at concentrations greatly exceeding those of the <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-isomer.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After intramuscular injection, the mean peak of serum total reduced folates was 436 ng/mL (range 240 to 725) and occurred at 52 minutes. Similar to IV administration, the initial sharp rise was due to the parent compound. The mean peak of 5-formyl-THF was 360 ng/mL and occurred at 28 minutes. The level of the metabolite 5-methyl-THF increased subsequently over time until at 1.5 hours it represented 50% of the circulating total folates. The mean peak of 5-methyl-THF was 226 ng/mL at 2.8 hours. The terminal half-life of total reduced folates was 6.2 hours. There was no difference of statistical significance between IM and IV administration in the AUC for total reduced folates, 5-formyl-THF, or 5-methyl-THF.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After oral administration of leucovorin reconstituted with aromatic elixir, the mean peak concentration of serum total reduced folates was 393 ng/mL (range 160 to 550). The mean time to peak was 2.3 hours and the terminal half-life was 5.7 hours. The major component was the metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to which leucovorin is primarily converted in the intestinal mucosa. The mean peak of 5-methyl-THF was 367 ng/mL at 2.4 hours. The peak level of the parent compound was 51 ng/mL at 1.2 hours. The AUC of total reduced folates after oral administration of the 25 mg dose was 92% of the AUC after intravenous administration.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following oral administration, leucovorin is rapidly absorbed and expands the serum pool of reduced folates. At a dose of 25 mg, almost 100% of the <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-isomer but only 20% of the <content styleCode="italics">d</content>-isomer is absorbed. Oral absorption of leucovorin is saturable at doses above 25 mg. The apparent bioavailability of leucovorin was 97% for 25 mg, 75% for 50 mg, and 37% for 100 mg.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a randomized clinical study conducted by the Mayo Clinic and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (Mayo/NCCTG) in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer three treatment regimens were compared: Leucovorin (LV) 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 370 mg/m<sup>2</sup> versus LV 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-FU 425 mg/m<sup>2</sup> versus 5-FU 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. All drugs were administered by slow intravenous infusion daily for 5 days repeated every 28 to 35 days. Response rates were 26% (p=0.04 versus 5-FU alone), 43% (p=0.001 versus 5-FU alone) and 10% for the high dose leucovorin, low dose leucovorin and 5-FU alone groups respectively. Respective median survival times were 12.2 months (p=0.037), 12 months (p=0.05), and 7.7 months. The low dose LV regimen gave a statistically significant improvement in weight gain of more than 5%, relief of symptoms, and improvement in performance status. The high dose LV regimen gave a statistically significant improvement in performance status and trended toward improvement in weight gain and in relief of symptoms but these were not statistically significant.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a second Mayo/NCCTG randomized clinical study the 5-FU alone arm was replaced by a regimen of sequentially administered methotrexate (MTX), 5-FU, and LV. Response rates with LV 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-FU 370 mg/m<sup>2</sup> versus LV 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-FU 425 mg/m<sup>2</sup> versus sequential MTX and 5-FU and LV were respectively 31% (p=&lt;0.01), 42% (p=&lt;0.01), and 14%. Respective median survival times were 12.7 months (p=&lt;0.04), 12.7 months (p=&lt;0.01), and 8.4 months. No statistically significant difference in weight gain of more than 5% or in improvement in performance status was seen between the treatment arms.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of 200 mg doses of leucovorin administered intravenously and orally (reconstituted powder, not tablets) have been evaluated in healthy male subjects. The serum clearance corrected for bioavailability, terminal half-life, and apparent volume of distribution of total folate were not significantly different between the routes of administration. The oral bioavailability of the 200 mg dose was 31%. Eighty-three percent of the biologically active IV dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, 31% as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Twenty percent of the same oral dose was excreted in 24 hours, 16% as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.

                  <paragraph>Leucovorin calcium rescue is indicated after high-dose methotrexate therapy in osteosarcoma. Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is also indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and of inadvertent overdosages of folic acid antagonists.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is indicated in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is also indicated for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Leucovorin Calcium for Injection should not be mixed in the same infusion as 5-fluorouracil because a precipitate may form.

</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>In the treatment of accidental overdosages of folic acid antagonists, intravenous leucovorin should be administered as promptly as possible. As the time interval between antifolate administration [e.g., methotrexate (MTX)] and leucovorin rescue increases, leucovorin's effectiveness in counteracting toxicity decreases. In the treatment of accidental overdosages of intrathecally administered folic acid antagonists, do not administer leucovorin intrathecally. LEUCOVORIN MAY BE HARMFUL OR FATAL IF GIVEN INTRATHECALLY.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitoring of the serum MTX concentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Delayed MTX excretion may be caused by a third space fluid accumulation (i.e., ascites, pleural effusion), renal insufficiency, or inadequate hydration. Under such circumstances, higher doses of leucovorin or prolonged administration may be indicated. Doses higher than those recommended for oral use must be given intravenously.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because of the benzyl alcohol contained in certain diluents used for leucovorin, when doses greater than 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> are administered, leucovorin should be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, and used immediately (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#s18">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>
                     </content>).
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160 mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16 mL of a 10 mg per mL, or 8 mL of a 20 mg per mL solution per minute).
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Leucovorin enhances the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. When these drugs are administered concurrently in the palliative therapy of advanced colorectal cancer, the dosage of 5-fluorouracil must be lower than usually administered. Although the toxicities observed in patients treated with the combination of leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil are qualitatively similar to those observed in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil alone, gastrointestinal toxicities (particularly stomatitis and diarrhea) are observed more commonly and may be more severe and of prolonged duration in patients treated with the combination.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the first Mayo/NCCTG controlled trial, toxicity, primarily gastrointestinal, resulted in 7% of patients requiring hospitalization when treated with 5-fluorouracil alone or 5-fluorouracil in combination with 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of leucovorin and 20% when treated with 5-fluorouracil in combination with 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of leucovorin. In the second Mayo/NCCTG trial, hospitalizations related to treatment toxicity also appeared to occur more often in patients treated with the low dose leucovorin/5-fluorouracil combination than in patients treated with the high dose combination — 11% versus 3%. Therapy with leucovorin/5-fluorouracil must not be initiated or continued in patients who have symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity of any severity, until those symptoms have completely resolved. Patients with diarrhea must be monitored with particular care until the diarrhea has resolved, as rapid clinical deterioration leading to death can occur. In an additional study utilizing higher weekly doses of 5-FU and leucovorin, elderly and/or debilitated patients were found to be at greater risk for severe gastrointestinal toxicity.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Seizures and/or syncope have been reported rarely in cancer patients receiving leucovorin, usually in association with fluoropyrimidine administration, and most commonly in those with CNS metastases or other predisposing factors, however, a causal relationship has not been established.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The concomitant use of leucovorin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <content styleCode="italics">Pneumocystis carinii</content> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and morbidity in a placebo-controlled study.

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of leucovorin did not show differences in safety or effectiveness between subjects over 65 and younger subjects. Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older patients cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to the drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elder patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The recommendations for leucovorin rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 to 15 grams/m<sup>2</sup> administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information).
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Leucovorin rescue at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion. In the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea or vomiting, leucovorin calcium for injection should be administered parenterally. Do not administer leucovorin calcium for injection intrathecally.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serum creatinine and methotrexate levels should be determined at least once daily. Leucovorin calcium for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> M (0.05 micromolar). The leucovorin calcium for injection dose should be adjusted or leucovorin rescue extended based on the guidelines provided in <linkHtml href="#t2">Table 2</linkHtml>.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who experience delayed early methotrexate elimination are likely to develop reversible renal failure. In addition to appropriate leucovorin calcium for injection therapy, these patients require continuing hydration and urinary alkalinization, and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some patients will have abnormalities in methotrexate elimination or renal function following methotrexate administration, which are significant but less severe than the abnormalities described in <linkHtml href="#t2">Table 2</linkHtml>. These abnormalities may or may not be associated with significant clinical toxicity. If significant clinical toxicity is observed, leucovorin rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total of 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy. The possibility that the patient is taking other medications which interact with methotrexate (e.g., medications which may interfere with methotrexate elimination or binding to serum albumin) should always be reconsidered when laboratory abnormalities or clinical toxicities are observed.

If the 24 hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24 hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10<sup>-6</sup> M or the 48 hour level is greater than 9 x 10<sup>-7</sup> M, the dose of leucovorin calcium for injection should be increased to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10<sup>-8</sup> M.

                        <paragraph>Hydration (3 L/d) and urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate solution should be employed concomitantly. The bicarbonate dose should be adjusted to maintain the urine pH at 7.0 or greater.

                        <paragraph>Up to 1 mg daily. There is no evidence that doses greater than 1 mg/day have greater efficacy than those of 1 mg; additionally, loss of folate in urine becomes roughly logarithmic as the amount administered exceeds 1 mg.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Each 500 mg vial of leucovorin calcium for injection when reconstituted with 50 mL of sterile diluent yields a leucovorin concentration of 10 mg per mL. Leucovorin calcium for injection contains no preservative. Reconstitute with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, which contains benzyl alcohol, or with Sterile Water for Injection, USP. When reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, the resulting solution must be used within 7 days. If the product is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, it must be used immediately.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the benzyl alcohol contained in Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, when doses greater than 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> are administered, leucovorin calcium for injection should be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, and used immediately (see <content styleCode="bold">

                           </content>). Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin calcium for injection solution, no more than 160 mg of leucovorin calcium for injection should be injected intravenously per minute (16 mL of a 10 mg per mL, or 8 mL of a 20 mg per mL solution per minute).
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Leucovorin calcium for injection should not be mixed in the same infusion as 5-fluorouracil, since this may lead to the formation of a precipitate.
