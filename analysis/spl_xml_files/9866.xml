                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice <content styleCode="italics">[see </content>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Nonclinical Toxicology (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_12e7b185-28bc-4f47-bf0c-f9b733d0fe39">13.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values &gt;50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide injection. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide injection should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide injection should not be restarted. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injection-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1,000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Liraglutide injection has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide injection.</paragraph>

There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking liraglutide injection, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing liraglutide injection could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking liraglutide injection.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of liraglutide injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 glycemic control, placebo-controlled trials in adults and one trial of 52 weeks duration in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_50ad5382-fb2c-4e2f-bc69-f74b2cc9b5fb">14.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 1,673 adult patients to liraglutide injection and a mean duration of exposure to liraglutide injection of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of adult patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years and a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% and moderately impaired in 12% of the pooled population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of liraglutide injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on liraglutide injection than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with liraglutide injection. Overall, the type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older and above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. </paragraph>

Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin &lt;20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to &gt;20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients.

                        <paragraph>Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to liraglutide injection during pregnancy. Liraglutide injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD <content styleCode="italics">[see Animal Data]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre-gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> &gt;7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> &gt;10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossification occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked ribs occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide-treated groups exceeding concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrowed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose-dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), ≥ 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), ≥ 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups, but not in the control group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pregnant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide-treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams. Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F<sub>2</sub> generation rats descended from liraglutide-treated rats compared to F<sub>2</sub> generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Liraglutide Injection contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Liraglutide Injection contains chemically synthesized Liraglutide that has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. The molecular formula of liraglutide is C<sub>172</sub>H<sub>265</sub>N<sub>43</sub>O<sub>51</sub> and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is:</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Liraglutide is an acylated human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37).  GLP-1(7-37) represents &lt;20% of total circulating endogenous GLP-1.  Like GLP-1(7-37), liraglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in pancreatic beta cells.  Liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations.  This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia.  Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.  The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>GLP-1(7-37) has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-IV and NEP.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those with liraglutide injection or other liraglutide products.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A subset of liraglutide injection-treated patients (1,104 of 2,501, 44%) in five adult double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_50ad5382-fb2c-4e2f-bc69-f74b2cc9b5fb">14.1</linkHtml>)]</content> and 102/1,104 (9%) of liraglutide injection-treated patients developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Of these 102 liraglutide injection-treated patients, 56 (5%) patients developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 12 (1%) of the liraglutide injection-treated patients. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-liraglutide antibodies on effectiveness of liraglutide injection.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In five double-blind adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of liraglutide injection-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for liraglutide injection-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical trial with pediatric patients aged 10 years and older <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_87e3f008-169f-472f-8908-5303bf85ce39">14.2</linkHtml>)],</content> anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 1 (2%) liraglutide injection-treated patient at week 26 and 5 (9%) liraglutide injection-treated patients at week 53. None of the 5 patients had antibodies cross reactive to native GLP-1 or had neutralizing antibodies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD-1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg/day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in males and 6% and 20% in females, respectively. C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment-related malignant C-cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/day group. Thyroid C-cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment-related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10-times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 104-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8-times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C-cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, 42%, and 46% and in all female liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 10%, 27%, 33%, and 56% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment-related increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide-treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females at 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Thyroid C-cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide-induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in thyroid C-cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_03e9f97d-af51-4d01-aee1-2a1c256dfcf4">Boxed Warning</linkHtml> and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_3ba8779e-df1f-498e-977f-b87d124e5f5c">5.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding an estimated systemic exposure 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In this 26-week trial, 1,091 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or glimepiride 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to metformin. Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2,000 mg/day. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add-on to metformin (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + metformin treatment group, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment group, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this 26 week, open-label trial, 665 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin ≥1,500 mg per day were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.2 mg once daily, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, all dosed according to approved labeling. Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre-trial dose level and dosing frequency.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, there was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg.</paragraph>

Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide injection titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;7% with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_d1e9e227-8fa0-436e-9533-e4d3088cf55d">6.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. The remaining 323 patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥7% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add-on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In this 26-week trial, 1,041 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 0.6 mg, liraglutide injection 1.2 mg, liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or rosiglitazone 4 mg (one-half of the maximal approved dose in the United States), all as add-on to glimepiride. Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in period consisting of an initial, 2-week, forced-glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add-on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the liraglutide injection 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In this 26-week trial, 581 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg, placebo, or insulin glargine, all as add-on to metformin and glimepiride. Randomization took place after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forced metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2,000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to liraglutide injection 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week period of titration with liraglutide injection. During the trial, the liraglutide injection and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice-weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine-treated patients achieved the pre-specified target fasting plasma glucose of ≤100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Participants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with liraglutide injection as add-on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the liraglutide injection 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In this 26week, open-label trial, 464 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a background of metformin monotherapy, sulfonylurea monotherapy or a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea were randomized to once daily liraglutide injection 1.8 mg or exenatide 10 mcg twice daily. Maximally tolerated doses of background therapy were to remain unchanged for the duration of the trial. Patients randomized to exenatide started on a dose of 5 mcg twice-daily for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10 mcg twice daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 51.9% male, 91.8% White, 5.4% Black or African American and 12.3% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with liraglutide injection 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG relative to exenatide (Table 9). The percentage of patients who discontinued for ineffective therapy was 0.4% in the liraglutide injection treatment group and 0% in the exenatide treatment group. Both treatment groups had a mean decrease from baseline in body weight of approximately 3 kg.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 279 patients with moderate renal impairment, as per MDRD formula (eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), were randomized to liraglutide injection or placebo once daily. Liraglutide injection was added to the patient's stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea). The dose of liraglutide injection was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≤ 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male, 92.3% White, 6.6% Black or African American, and 7.2% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and &lt;45mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with liraglutide injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of liraglutide injection.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Liraglutide injection was evaluated in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multicenter trial (NCT01541215), in 134 pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 years and older. Patients were randomized to liraglutide injection once-daily or placebo once-daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dose of 1,000 to 2,000 mg prior to randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide injection was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of ≤110 mg/dL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age was 14.6 years: 29.9% were ages 10 to 14 years, and 70.1% were greater than 14 years of age. 38.1% were male, 64.9% were White, 13.4% were Asian, 11.9% were Black or African American; 29.1% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and the mean BMI SDS was 2.9. 18.7% of patients were using basal insulin at baseline. The mean duration of diabetes was 1.9 years and the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 7.8%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At week 26, treatment with liraglutide injection was superior in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline versus placebo. The estimated treatment difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction from baseline between liraglutide injection and placebo was -1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of [-1.65%; -0.46%] (see Table 12).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Prior to first use, Liraglutide Injection should be stored in a refrigerator between 36ºF to 46ºF (2ºC to 8ºC). Do not store in the freezer or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element. Do not freeze Liraglutide Injection and do not use Liraglutide Injection if it has been frozen. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After first use of the Liraglutide Injection pen, the pen can be stored for 30 days at controlled room temperature (59°F to 86°F; 15°C to 30°C) or in a refrigerator (36°F to 46°F; 2°C to 8°C). Keep the pen cap on when not in use. Protect Liraglutide Injection from excessive heat and sunlight. Always remove and safely discard the needle after each injection and store the Liraglutide Injection pen without an injection needle attached. This will reduce the potential for contamination, infection, and leakage while also ensuring dosing accuracy. Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Your liraglutide injection pen is a disposable single-patient-use prefilled pen injector that contains 3 mL of liraglutide injection and will deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The number of doses that you can take with a liraglutide injection pen depends on the dose of medicine that is prescribed for you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much liraglutide injection to take.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Liraglutide injection pen should be used with compatible disposable needles. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about needles for your liraglutide injection pen.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>   Δ Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ Keep your liraglutide injection pen and all medicines out of the reach of children.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ If you drop your liraglutide injection pen, repeat “First Time Use For Each New Pen” (steps A through D).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ Be careful not to bend or damage the needle.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide injection to inject.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>   Δ You can use your liraglutide injection pen for up to 30 days after you use it the first time.</paragraph>
