                        <paragraph ID="ID18">Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been   done with corticosteroids, use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers   or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the   drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or   fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of   corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of   hypoadrenalism.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Average and large doses of cortisone or hydrocortisone   can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and   increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with   the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Patients with a   stressed myocardium should be observed carefully and the drug administered   slowly since premature ventricular contractions may occur with rapid   administration. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be   necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be   vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be   undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially in high doses,   because of possible hazards of neurological complications and lack of antibody   response.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID20">Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be   minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency   may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any   situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be   reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or   a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.</paragraph>

Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be   aggravated by corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with   corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Steroids should be used with caution in   nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending   perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection, also in diverticulitis,   fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal   insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Appropriate   examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic   process.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A marked   increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint   motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this   complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate   antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Local   injection of a steroid into a previously infected joint is to be avoided.   Corticosteroids should not be injected into unstable joints.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although   controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in   speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis they do   not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the   disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids   are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See Dosage and   Administration Section).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Since   complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of   the dose and the duration of treatment a risk/benefit decision must be made   in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to   whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The initial   dosage of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection may vary from 0.50 mg/day   to 9.0 mg/day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In   situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in   selected patients higher initial doses may be required. Usually the   parenteral dosage ranges are one-third to one-half the oral dose given every   12 hours. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening   situations, administration of dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be   justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the   treatment of unresponsive shock high pharmacologic doses of this product are   currently</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>recommended.   Reported regimens range from 1 to 6 mg/kg of body weight as a single   intravenous injection to 40 mg initially followed by repeat intravenous   injection every 2 to 6 hours while shock persists.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the   treatment of cerebral edema in adults an initial intravenous dose of 10 mg is   recommended followed by 4 mg intramuscularly every six hours until maximum   response has been noted. This regimen may be continued for several days   postoperatively in patients requiring brain surgery. Oral dexamethasone, 1 to   3 mg t.i.d., should be given as soon as possible and dosage tapered off over   a period of five to seven days. Nonoperative cases may require continuous   therapy to remain free of symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. The   smallest effective dose should be used in children, preferably orally. This   may approximate 0.2 mg/kg/24 hours in divided doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In   treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg   of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4–8 mg   dexamethasone every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The initial   dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is   noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory   clinical response, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection should be   discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It   should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be   individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response   of the patient.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After a   favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be   determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at   appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an   adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that   constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the   situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in   clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease   process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness and the effect of   patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease   entity under treatment. In this later situation it may be necessary to   increase the dosage of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection for a period   of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after a long-term   therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn   gradually rather than abruptly.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">B.   Intra-articular, soft tissue or intralesional administration</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The dose   for intrasynovial administration is usually 2 to 4 mg for large joints and   0.8 to 1 mg for small joints. For soft tissue and bursal injections a dose of   2 to 4 mg is recommended. Ganglia require a dose of 1 to 2 mg. A dose of 0.4   to 1 mg is used for injection into tendon sheaths. Injection into   intervertebral joints should not be attempted at any time and hip joint   injection cannot be recommended as an office procedure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intrasynovial   and soft tissue injections should be employed only when affected areas are   limited to 1 or 2 sites. It should be remembered that corticoids provide   palliation only and that other conventional or curative methods of therapy   should be employed when indicated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be   inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to   administration, whenever the solution and container permit.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Frequency of injection usually ranges   from once every 3 to 5 days to once every 2 to 3 weeks. Frequent   intra-articular injection may cause damage to joint tissue.</paragraph>
