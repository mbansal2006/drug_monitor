                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations in healthy adults and pediatric populations vary widely from individual to individual. Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in healthy adults, the peak serum concentration averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32 mcg/mL. Absorption of rifampin is reduced by about 30% when the drug is ingested with food.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and, therefore, diffuses freely into tissues.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy adults, the mean biological half-life of rifampin in serum averages 3.35±0.66 hours after a 600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.08±2.45 hours reported after a 900 mg dose. With repeated administration, the half-life decreases and reaches average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half-life does not differ in patients with renal failure at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily, and, consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. The half-life of rifampin at a dose of 720 mg daily has not been established in patients with renal failure. Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, the mean half-life increased from 3.6 hours in healthy adults to 5.0, 7.3, and 11.0 hours in patients with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 50 mL/min, less than 30 mL/min, and in anuric patients, respectively. Refer to the <linkHtml href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</linkHtml> section for information regarding patients with hepatic insufficiency.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After absorption, rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile, and an enterohepatic circulation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes progressive deacetylation so that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this form in about 6 hours. This metabolite has antibacterial activity. Intestinal reabsorption is reduced by deacetylation, and elimination is facilitated. Up to 30% of a dose is excreted in the urine, with about half of this being unchanged drug.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>After intravenous administration of a 300 or 600 mg dose of rifampin infused over 30 minutes to healthy male volunteers (n=12), mean peak plasma concentrations were 9.0±3.0 and 17.5±5.0 mcg/mL, respectively. Total body clearances after the 300 and 600 mg IV doses were 0.19±0.06 and 0.14±0.03 L/hr/kg, respectively. Volumes of distribution at steady state were 0.66±0.14 and 0.64±0.11 L/kg for the 300 and 600 mg IV doses, respectively. After intravenous administration of 300 or 600 mg doses, rifampin plasma concentrations in these volunteers remained detectable for 8 and 12 hours, respectively (see <linkHtml href="#table">Table</linkHtml>). </paragraph>

The individual serum half-life of rifampin changed from 1.04 to 3.81 hours early in therapy to 1.17 to 3.19 hours 5 to 14 days after therapy was initiated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of 22 pediatric patients (median gestational age 27.5 weeks [range; 23–41 weeks] and median postnatal age (PNA) 7.5 days [range: 0–56 days]) receiving intravenous rifampin 10–20 mg/kg/day over 30 minutes, pediatric patients ≤7 days old had a median clearance of 0.09 L/kg/hr (range: 0.056–0.14 L/kg/hr) and a median area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve at infinity (AUC∞) of 105 mg*hr/L (range: 80172 mg*hr/L);  pediatric patients &gt;7 days PNA had a median clearance of 0.23 L/kg/hr (range:  0.14–0.32 L/kg/hr) and a median AUC∞ of 78 mg*hr/L (range: 51–170 mg*hr/L). </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Based on PK modeling and simulation analyses, a dose of 12 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes once daily in  pediatric patients ≤7 days PNA resulted in median (90% prediction interval) for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 8.4 mcg/mL (range: 5.3 – 13.3 mcg/mL) and AUC∞ of 96.4 mg*hr/L (range: 64.5 – 141.6 mg*hr/L); in pediatric patients &gt;7 days and &lt; 90 days PNA  a dose of 14 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes once daily resulted in a median (90% prediction interval) for Cmax of 9.6 mcg/mL (range: 6.l – 15.1 mcg/mL) and AUC∞ of 73.l mg*hr/L (range: 45.6 – 131.6 mg*hr/L). All simulated AUC∞ were within the range of AUC∞ values reported in other studies in adults treated for tuberculosis.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In the treatment of both tuberculosis and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. If test results show resistance to rifampin and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months.

                  <paragraph>RIFADIN is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin or any of the components, or to any of the rifamycins.  (See <linkHtml href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin is contraindicated in patients who are also receiving ritonavir-boosted saquinavir due to an increased risk of severe hepatocellular toxicity. (See <linkHtml href="#DI">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin is contraindicated in patients who are also receiving atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir due to the potential of rifampin to substantially decrease plasma concentrations of these antiviral drugs, which may result in loss of antiviral efficacy and/or development of viral resistance.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin is contraindicated in patients receiving praziquantel since therapeutically effective blood levels of praziquantel may not be achieved. In patients receiving rifampin who need immediate treatment with praziquantel alternative agents should be considered. However, if treatment with praziquantel is necessary, rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks before administration of praziquantel. Treatment with rifampin can then be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin is contraindicated in patients receiving lurasidone. Concomitant use of lurasidone with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) decreased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone alone.

                  <paragraph>Hepatotoxicity of hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed patterns has been reported in patients treated with rifampin. Severity ranged from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes, isolated jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia, symptomatic self-limited hepatitis to fulminant liver failure and death. Severe hepatic dysfunction including fatalities were reported in patients with liver disease and in patients taking rifampin with other hepatotoxic agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitor for symptoms and clinical/laboratory signs of liver injury, especially if treatment is prolonged or given with other hepatotoxic drugs. Patients with impaired liver function should be given rifampin only in cases of necessity and then under strict medical supervision. In these patients, careful monitoring of liver function should be done prior to therapy and then every 2 to 4 weeks during therapy. If signs of hepatic damage occur or worsen, discontinue rifampin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin has enzyme-inducing properties, including induction of delta amino levulinic acid synthetase. Isolated reports have associated porphyria exacerbation with rifampin administration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The possibility of rapid emergence of resistant meningococci restricts the use of RIFADIN to short-term treatment of the asymptomatic carrier state. <content styleCode="bold">RIFADIN is not to be used for the treatment of meningococcal disease.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Systemic hypersensitivity reactions were reported with RIFADIN administration. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions may include fever, rash, urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, acute bronchospasm, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, elevated liver transaminases or flu-like syndrome (weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, chills, aches, itching, sweats, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, syncope, palpitations). Manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever, lymphadenopathy or laboratory abnormalities (including eosinophilia, liver abnormalities) may be present even though rash is not evident. Monitor patients receiving RIFADIN for signs and/or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If these signs or symptoms occur, discontinue RIFADIN and administer supportive measures.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with rifampin. If symptoms or signs of severe cutaneous adverse reactions develop, discontinue RIFADIN immediately and institute appropriate therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rifampin may cause vitamin K–dependent coagulation disorders and bleeding (see <linkHtml href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). Monitor coagulation tests during rifampin treatment (prothrombin time and other coagulation tests) in patients at risk of vitamin K deficiency (such as those with chronic liver disease, poor nutritional status, on prolonged antibacterial drugs or anticoagulants). Consider discontinuation of RIFADIN if abnormal coagulation tests and/or bleeding occur. Supplemental vitamin K administration should be considered when appropriate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pulmonary toxicity manifested as interstitial lung disease (including, but not limited to, pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates, and organizing pneumonia) has been reported with rifampin treatment. Pulmonary toxicity could be fatal. If symptoms or signs of severe pulmonary toxicity (including respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) develop, discontinue RIFADIN immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of high doses of cefazolin and rifampin may prolong the prothrombin time, leading to severe vitamin K–dependent coagulation disorders that may be life-threatening or fatal. Avoid concomitant use of cefazolin and rifampin in patients at increased risk for bleeding. If no alternative treatment options are available, closely monitor prothrombin time and other coagulation tests, and administer vitamin K as indicated. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of paradoxical drug reaction (recurrence or appearance of new symptoms, physical and radiological signs in a patient who had previously shown improvement with appropriate antimycobacterial treatment, in the absence of disease relapse, poor treatment compliance, drug resistance, side effects of treatment, or secondary infection/diagnosis) have been reported with RIFADIN (see <linkHtml href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). Paradoxical drug reactions are often transient and should not be misinterpreted as failure to respond to treatment. If worsening of symptoms or signs occurs during antimycobacterial treatment, consider paradoxical drug reaction in the differential diagnosis, monitor, or treat accordingly.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremia syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with rifampin. Discontinue RIFADIN if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur. The findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia should prompt further evaluation and consideration of the diagnosis of TMA.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>RIFADIN should be used with caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, as diabetes management may be more difficult.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescribing rifampin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For the treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin is usually administered on a daily basis. Doses of rifampin greater than 600 mg given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "flu syndrome" (fever, chills, and malaise), hematopoietic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or acute hemolytic anemia), cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions, shortness of breath, shock, anaphylaxis, and renal failure. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin has enzyme induction properties that can enhance the metabolism of endogenous substrates including adrenal hormones, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D. Rifampin and isoniazid have been reported to alter vitamin D metabolism. In some cases, reduced levels of circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D have been accompanied by reduced serum calcium and phosphate, and elevated parathyroid hormone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When rifampin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of the teeth, urine, sweat, sputum, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this.</content> Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin is a well characterized and potent inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and might therefore decrease or increase concomitant drug exposure and impact safety and efficacy (see <linkHtml href="#DI">DRUG INTERACTIONS</linkHtml>). Therefore, patients should be advised not to take any other medication without medical advice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, and pain or swelling of the joints.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see <linkHtml href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.</paragraph>

Baseline tests are unnecessary in pediatric patients unless a complicating condition is known or clinically suspected.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary.

                                    <paragraph>Drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters affected by rifampin include cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGT), sulfotransferases, carboxylesterases, and transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2). Most drugs are substrates for one or more of these enzyme or transporter pathways and these pathways may be induced by rifampin simultaneously. Therefore, rifampin may increase the metabolism and decrease the activity of certain coadministered drugs or increase the activity of a coadministered pro-drug (where metabolic activation is required), and has the potential to perpetuate clinically important drug-drug interactions against many drugs and across many drug classes (Table 1).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cross-reactivity and false-positive urine screening tests for opiates have been reported in patients receiving rifampin when using the KIMS (Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution) method (e.g., Abuscreen OnLine opiates assay; Roche Diagnostic Systems). Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish rifampin from opiates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therapeutic levels of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Thus, alternate assay methods should be considered. Transient abnormalities in liver function tests (e.g., elevation in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum transaminases) and reduced biliary excretion of contrast media used for visualization of the gallbladder have also been observed. Therefore, these tests should be performed before the morning dose of rifampin.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Rifampin has been shown to be teratogenic in rodents. Congenital malformations, primarily spina bifida, were increased in the offspring of pregnant rats given rifampin during organogenesis at oral doses of 150 to 250 mg/kg/day (about 1 to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons). Cleft palate was increased in a dose-dependent fashion in fetuses of pregnant mice treated at oral doses of 50 to 200 mg/kg (about 0.2 to 0.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons). Imperfect osteogenesis and embryotoxicity were also reported in pregnant rabbits given rifampin at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (about 3 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of RIFADIN in pregnant women.  Rifampin has been reported to cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. RIFADIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, headache, and increasing lethargy will probably occur within a short time after ingestion; unconsciousness may occur when there is severe hepatic disease. Transient increases in liver enzymes and/or bilirubin may occur. Brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces will occur, and its intensity is proportional to the amount ingested.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Liver enlargement, possibly with tenderness, can develop within a few hours after severe overdosage; bilirubin levels may increase and jaundice may develop rapidly. Hepatic involvement may be more marked in patients with prior impairment of hepatic function. Other physical findings remain essentially normal. A direct effect upon the hematopoietic system, electrolyte levels, or acid-base balance is unlikely. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Facial or periorbital edema has also been reported in pediatric patients. Hypotension, sinus tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest were reported in some fatal cases.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Intensive support measures should be instituted and individual symptoms treated as they arise. The airway should be secured and adequate respiratory exchange established. Since nausea and vomiting are likely to be present, gastric lavage within the first 2 to 3 hours after ingestion is probably preferable to induction of emesis. Following evacuation of the gastric contents, the instillation of activated charcoal slurry into the stomach may help absorb any remaining drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Antiemetic medication may be required to control severe nausea and vomiting. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Active diuresis (with measured intake and output) will help promote excretion of the drug. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For severe cases, extracorporeal hemodialysis may be required. If this is not available, peritoneal dialysis can be used along with forced diuresis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>It is recommended that oral rifampin be administered once daily, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still sputum or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive.</paragraph>
