                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Antiviral Activity</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes, i.e., H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. It has very little or no activity against influenza B virus isolates. A quantitative relationship between the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> susceptibility of influenza A virus to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in man. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of amantadine required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus (ED<sub>50</sub>) in tissue culture vary greatly (from 0.1 mcg/mL to 25.0 mcg/mL) depending upon the assay protocol used, size of virus inoculum, isolates of influenza A virus strains tested, and the cell type used. Host cells in tissue culture readily tolerated amantadine up to a concentration of 100 mcg/mL.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Drug Resistance</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Influenza A variants with reduced <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> sensitivity to amantadine have been isolated from epidemic strains in areas where adamantane derivatives are being used. Influenza viruses with reduced <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> sensitivity have been shown to be transmissible and to cause typical influenza illness. The quantitative relationship between the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> sensitivity of influenza A variants to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="italics">Parkinson's Disease</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions is not known. Data from earlier animal studies suggest that amantadine may have direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons. More recent studies have demonstrated that amantadine is a weak, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (K<sub>1</sub> = 10μM). Although amantadine has not been shown to possess direct anticholinergic activity in animal studies, clinically, it exhibits anticholinergic-like side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Amantadine is well absorbed orally. Maximum plasma concentrations are directly related to dose for doses up to 200 mg/day. Doses above 200 mg/day may result in a greater than proportional increase in maximum plasma concentrations. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Eight metabolites of amantadine have been identified in human urine. One metabolite, an N-acetylated compound, was quantified in human urine and accounted for 5 to 15% of the administered dose. Plasma acetylamantadine accounted for up to 80% of the concurrent amantadine plasma concentration in 5 of 12 healthy volunteers following the ingestion of a 200 mg dose of amantadine. Acetylamantadine was not detected in the plasma of the remaining seven volunteers. The contribution of this metabolite to efficacy or toxicity is not known</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There appears to be a relationship between plasma amantadine concentrations and toxicity. As concentration increases, toxicity seems to be more prevalent, however, absolute values of amantadine concentrations associated with adverse effects have not been fully defined.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Amantadine pharmacokinetics were determined in 24 normal adult male volunteers after the oral administration of a single amantadine hydrochloride 100 mg soft gel capsule. The mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration was 0.22 ± 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0.18 to 0.32 mcg/mL). The time to peak concentration was 3.3 ± 1.5 hours (range 1.5 to 8.0 hours). The apparent oral clearance was 0.28 ± 0.11 L/hr/kg (range: 0.14 to 0.62 L/hr/kg). The half-life was 17 ± 4 hours (range: 10 to 25 hours). Across other studies, amantadine plasma half-life has averaged 16 ± 6 hours (range: 9 to 31 hours) in 19 healthy volunteers.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg amantadine syrup to five healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration C<sub>max</sub> was 0.24 ± 0.04 mcg/mL and ranged from 0.18 to 0.28 mcg/mL. After 15 days of amantadine 100 mg b.i.d., the C<sub>max</sub> was 0.47 ± 0.11 mcg/mL in four of the five volunteers. The administration of amantadine tablets as a 200 mg single dose to 6 healthy subjects resulted in a C<sub>max</sub> of 0.51 ± 0.14 mcg/mL. Across studies, the time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) averaged about 2 to 4 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Plasma amantadine clearance ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 L/hr/kg after the administration of 5 mg to 25 mg intravenous doses of amantadine to 15 healthy volunteers.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In six healthy volunteers, the ratio of amantadine renal clearance to apparent oral plasma clearance was 0.79 ± 0.17 (mean ± SD)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The volume of distribution determined after the intravenous administration of amantadine to 15 healthy subjects was 3 to 8 L/kg, suggesting tissue binding. Amantadine, after single oral 200 mg doses to 6 healthy young subjects and to 6 healthy elderly subjects has been found in nasal mucus at mean ± SD concentrations of 0.15 ± 0.16, 0.28 ± 0.26, and 0.39 ± 0.34 mcg/g at 1, 4 and 8 hours after dosing, respectively. These concentrations represented 31 ± 33%, 59 ± 61% and 95 ± 86% of the corresponding plasma amantadine concentrations. Amantadine is approximately 67% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0 mcg/mL. Following the administration of amantadine 100 mg as a single dose, the mean ± SD red blood cell to plasma ratio ranged from 2.7 ± 0.5 in 6 healthy subjects to 1.4 ± 0.2 in 8 patients with renal insufficiency.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The apparent oral plasma clearance of amantadine is reduced and the plasma half-life and plasma concentrations are increased in healthy elderly individuals age 60 and older. After single dose administration of 25 to 75 mg to 7 healthy, elderly male volunteers, the apparent plasma clearance of amantadine was 0.10 ± 0.04 L/hr/kg (range 0.06 to 0.17 L/hr/kg) and the half-life was 29 ± 7 hours (range 20 to 41 hours). Whether these changes are due to decline in renal function or other age related factors is not known.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a study of young healthy subjects (n=20), mean renal clearance of amantadine, normalized for body mass index, was 1.5 fold higher in males compared to females (p&lt;0.032)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Compared with otherwise healthy adult individuals, the clearance of amantadine is significantly reduced in adult patients with renal insufficiency. The elimination half-life increases two to three fold or greater when creatinine clearance is less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and averages eight days in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis. Amantadine is removed in negligible amounts by hemodialysis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine. Since the excretion rate of amantadine increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Amantadine hydrochloride capsules are indicated for  chemoprophylaxis against signs and symptoms of influenza A virus infection. Because amantadine does not completely prevent the host immune response to influenza A infection, individuals who take this drug may still develop immune responses to natural disease or vaccination and may be protected when later exposed to antigenically related viruses. Following vaccination during an influenza A outbreak, amantadine prophylaxis should be considered for the 2- to 4-week time period required to develop an antibody response.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Deaths have been reported from overdose with amantadine. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of amantadine. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity.

The incidence of suicide attempts is not known and the pathophysiologic mechanism is not understood. Suicide attempts and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients with and without prior history of psychiatric illness. Amantadine can exacerbate mental problems in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse. Patients who attempt suicide may exhibit abnormal mental states which include disorientation, confusion, depression, personality changes, agitation, aggressive behavior, hallucinations, paranoia, other psychotic reactions and somnolence or insomnia. Because of the possibility of serious adverse effects, caution should be observed when prescribing amantadine hydrochloride capsules to patients being treated with drugs having CNS effects, or for whom the potential risks outweigh the benefit of treatment.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID16">Amantadine should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of amantadine should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sporadic cases of possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of amantadine therapy. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of amantadine is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia; neurologic findings including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness; mental status changes; other disturbances such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because amantadine is mainly excreted in the urine, it accumulates in the plasma and in the body when renal function declines. Thus, the dose of amantadine should be reduced in patients with renal impairment and in individuals who are 65 years of age or older (see <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>: <content styleCode="bold">Dosage for Impaired Renal Function</content>)</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including amantadine hydrochloride. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with amantadine hydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking amantadine hydrochloride.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using amantadine for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).</paragraph>

Care should be exercised when administering amantadine to patients with a history of recurrent eczematoid rash, or to patients with psychosis or severe psychoneurosis not controlled by chemotherapeutic agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Amantadine has not been shown to prevent such complications.</paragraph>

However, in two non-GLP studies in rats in which females were dosed from 5 days  prior to mating to Day 6 of gestation or on Days 7 to 14 of  gestation, amantadine produced increases in embryonic death at  an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (or 3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). In the non-GLP rat study in which females were dosed on Days 7 to 14 of gestation, there was a marked increase in severe visceral and skeletal malformations at oral doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg (or 1.5 and 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The no-effect dose for teratogenicity was 37 mg/kg (equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The safety margins reported may not accurately reflect the risk considering the questionable quality of the study on which they are based. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Human data regarding teratogenicity after maternal use of amantadine is scarce. Tetralogy of Fallot and tibial hemimelia (normal karyotype) occurred in an infant exposed to amantadine during the first trimester of pregnancy (100 mg P.O. for 7 days during the 6th and 7th week of gestation). Cardiovascular maldevelopment (single ventricle with pulmonary atresia) was associated with maternal exposure to amantadine (100 mg/d) administered during the first 2 weeks of pregnancy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amantadine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph ID="ID32">Deaths have been reported from overdose with amantadine. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Because some patients have attempted suicide by overdosing with amantadine, prescriptions should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of amantadine. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity. Cardiac dysfunction includes arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress (including adult respiratory distress syndrome – ARDS) have been reported; renal dysfunction including increased BUN, decreased creatinine clearance and renal insufficiency can occur. Central nervous system effects that have been reported include insomnia, anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia, gait abnormality, tremor, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, fear, delirium, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, lethargy, somnolence and coma. Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed in cases where a drug overdose has occurred.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no specific antidote for an overdose of amantadine. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult<sup>2</sup> at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child<sup>3</sup> at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by amantadine hydrochloride. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine. Since the excretion rate of amantadine increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered. The patient should be observed for the possible development of arrhythmias and hypotension; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic and antihypotensive therapy should be given.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Electrocardiographic monitoring may be required after ingestion, since malignant tachyarrhythmias can appear after overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Care should be exercised when administering adrenergic agents, such as isoproterenol, to patients with an amantadine overdose, since the dopaminergic activity of amantadine has been reported to induce malignant arrhythmias.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The blood electrolytes, urine pH and urinary output should be monitored. If there is no record of recent voiding, catheterization should be done.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The adult daily dosage of amantadine hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg; two 100 mg capsules as a single daily dose. The daily dosage may be split into one capsule of 100 mg twice a day. If central nervous system effects develop in once-a-day dosage, a split dosage schedule may reduce such complaints. In persons 65 years of age or older, the daily dosage of amantadine hydrochloride capsules is 100 mg.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A 100 mg daily dose has also been shown in experimental challenge studies to be effective as prophylaxis in healthy adults who are not at high risk for influenza-related complications. However, it has not been demonstrated that a 100 mg daily dose is as effective as a 200 mg daily dose for prophylaxis, nor has the 100 mg daily dose been studied in the treatment of acute influenza illness. In recent clinical trials, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with the 100 mg daily dose was at or near the level of placebo. The 100 mg dose is recommended for persons who have demonstrated intolerance to 200 mg of amantadine hydrochloride daily because of CNS or other toxicities.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The total daily dose is 200 mg given as one capsule of 100 mg twice a day. The 100 mg daily dose has not been studied in this pediatric population. Therefore, there are no data which demonstrate that this dose is as effective as or is safer than the 200 mg daily dose in this patient population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prophylactic dosing should be started in anticipation of an influenza A outbreak and before or after contact with individuals with influenza A virus respiratory tract illness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Amantadine hydrochloride capsules should be continued daily for at least 10 days following a known exposure. If amantadine is used chemoprophylactically in conjunction with inactivated influenza A virus vaccine until protective antibody responses develop, then it should be administered for 2 to 4 weeks after the vaccine has been given. When inactivated influenza A virus vaccine is unavailable or contraindicated, amantadine hydrochloride capsules should be administered for the duration of known influenza A in the community because of repeated and unknown exposure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment of influenza A virus illness should be started as soon as possible, preferably within 24 to 48 hours after onset of signs and symptoms, and should be continued for 24 to 48 hours after the disappearance of signs and symptoms.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The usual dose of amantadine hydrochloride capsules is 100 mg twice a day when used alone. Amantadine has an onset of action usually within 48 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The initial dose of amantadine hydrochloride capsules is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs. After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with amantadine hydrochloride capsules at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses. However, such patients should be supervised closely by their physicians.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients initially deriving benefit from amantadine hydrochloride capsules not uncommonly experience a fall-off of effectiveness after a few months. Benefit may be regained by increasing the dose to 300 mg daily. Alternatively, temporary discontinuation of amantadine hydrochloride capsules for several weeks, followed by reinitiation of the drug, may result in regaining benefit in some patients. A decision to use other antiparkinson drugs may be necessary.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Some patients who do not respond to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs may respond to amantadine hydrochloride capsules. When amantadine hydrochloride capsules or anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs are each used with marginal benefit, concomitant use may produce additional benefit.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When amantadine and levodopa are initiated concurrently, the patient can exhibit rapid therapeutic benefits. Amantadine hydrochloride capsules should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When amantadine is added to optimal well-tolerated doses of levodopa, additional benefit may result, including smoothing out the fluctuations in improvement which sometimes occur in patients on levodopa alone. Patients who require a reduction in their usual dose of levodopa because of development of side effects may possibly regain lost benefit with the addition of amantadine hydrochloride capsules.</paragraph>
