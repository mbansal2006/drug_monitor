                     <content styleCode="italics">In vitro </content>studies and 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta 
  <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol.  While it is recognized that beta 
  <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta 
  <sub>2</sub>-receptors in the human heart existing in a concentration between 10% and 50%.  The precise function of these receptors has not been established (see 
  <linkHtml href="#b45c3eeb-fb36-42f6-8824-d4c0b1d62605">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, including albuterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes. Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for catechol- O-methyl transferase.</paragraph>

Most of the absorbed dose was recovered in the urine 24 hours after drug administration. Following a 3 mg dose of nebulized albuterol, the maximum albuterol plasma level at 0.5 hour was 2.1 ng/mL (range 1.4 to 3.2 ng/mL). There was a significant dose-related response in FEV

Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol inhalation solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression.

                        <paragraph>Repeated dosing with 0.15 mg/kg of albuterol inhalation solution in children aged 5 to 17 years who were initially normokalemic has been associated with an asymptomatic decline of 20% to 25% in serum potassium levels.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">Information for Patients: </content>The action of albuterol inhalation solution may last up to 6 hours or longer. Albuterol inhalation solution should not be used more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol inhalation solution without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with albuterol inhalation solution becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms become worse, and/or you need to use the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are using albuterol inhalation solution, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor or nervousness. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of albuterol inhalation solution. Effective and safe use of albuterol  inhalation solution includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered.

                                 </content>Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol  inhalation solution, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

                  <paragraph>The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under
 
  <linkHtml href="#b73d77d7-16d4-4cb2-9293-7c56fd3c2073">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>, e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and sleeplessness. Hypokalemia may also occur. In isolated cases in children 2 to 12 years of age, tachycardia with rates &gt; 200 beats/min has been observed. As with all sympathomimetic l medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of albuterol inhalation solution. Treatment consists of discontinuation of albuterol inhalation solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of albuterol inhalation solution.

                  <paragraph>The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2000 mg/kg (approximately 810 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on an mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis or approximately 300 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). In mature rats, the subcutaneous (sc) median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate is approximately 450 mg/kg (approximately  365 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on an mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis or approximately 135 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). In small young rats, the sc median lethal dose is approximately 2000 mg/kg (approximately 1600 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis or approximately 600 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). The inhalational median lethal dose has not been determined in animals.

                  <paragraph>The usual dosage for adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg of albuterol (one unit-of-use vial) administered 3 to 4 times daily by nebulization. More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended. To administer 2.5 mg of albuterol, dilute 0.5 mL of the 0.5% solution for inhalation to a total volume of 3 mL with sterile normal saline solution and administer by nebulization.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The flow rate is regulated to suit the particular nebulizer so that albuterol inhalation solution will be delivered over approximately 5 to 15 minutes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of albuterol inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of albuterol  inhalation solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During treatment, most patients gain optimum benefit from regular use of the nebulizer solution.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma which would require reassessment of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The nebulizer should be cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Failure to do so could lead to bacterial contamination of the nebulizer and possible infection.</paragraph>
