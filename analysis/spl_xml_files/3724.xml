                              <paragraph>During the first cycle of OCELLA use, instruct the patient to take one yellow OCELLA daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one yellow OCELLA daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. OCELLA should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals. If OCELLA is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, OCELLA should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>During the first cycle of OCELLA use, instruct the patient to take one yellow OCELLA daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period. She should take one yellow OCELLA daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. OCELLA should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals. OCELLA should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of OCELLA on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her yellow tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last white tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of OCELLA is started later than the day following administration of the last white tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a yellow OCELLA daily for seven consecutive days.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, OCELLA should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, OCELLA should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, OCELLA should be started on the day of removal. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last yellow tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking OCELLA, instruct the patient to continue taking OCELLA by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if OCELLA is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue OCELLA if pregnancy is confirmed.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The risk of pregnancy increases with each active yellow tablet missed. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more white tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of yellow tablets on the proper day.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start OCELLA no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts OCELLA postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken OCELLA for 7 consecutive days.  </paragraph>

Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of OCELLA in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID_d965f941-caee-4452-b3cb-3bfbc4788bdf">4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 3 mg of DRSP and 0.03 mg of EE) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 2.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 2): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 2), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. <content styleCode="xmChange">Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly.

                     <title>5.10  Bleeding Irregularities </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took OCELLA and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the OCELLA trials (&lt;1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use OCELLA may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users (&lt;6 months since last use) and never users of COCs (Figure 3).

                           </content> Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure.

In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure.

                        <paragraph>COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.

Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to CHCs before conception or during early pregnancy. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of OCELLA, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE, has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1-2 hours after administration of OCELLA.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1-10 mg. Following daily dosing of OCELLA, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC (0-24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of OCELLA (see Table 3).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of OCELLA serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC (0-24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4–5 L/kg.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation.  These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and the hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of  EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38-47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17-20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30-65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50–79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr ≥ 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30–49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. <content styleCode="italics">[See Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID_d965f941-caee-4452-b3cb-3bfbc4788bdf">4</linkHtml>) and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_6c2301dc-a012-4262-90c9-c23ec7723454">5.2</linkHtml>).]</content>

Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>studies. In <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found.

                  <paragraph>OCELLA is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take OCELLA if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether OCELLA is right for you, and during the first month that you take OCELLA, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on the results of two clinical studies, about 1 woman out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use OCELLA.</paragraph>

Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">How Do I Take OCELLA?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>1. <content styleCode="bold">Be sure to read these directions</content> before you start taking your pills or anytime you are not sure what to do.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Preferably, take the pill after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS” below.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3. Many women have spotting or light bleeding at unexpected times, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1-3 packs of pills.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed pills.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>On the days you take two pills, to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5. If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS." If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's Wort, your pills may not work as well.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>6. If you have trouble remembering to take the pill, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>7. <content styleCode="bold">If you have any questions or are unsure about the information in this leaflet, call your healthcare provider.</content>

                  <paragraph>1. Decide What Time of Day You Want to Take Your Pill </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is important to take OCELLA in the order directed on the package at the same time every day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. Look at Your Pill Pack – It has 28 Pills </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>a) Where on the pack to start taking pills,</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>b) In what order to take the pills (follow the arrows)</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>4. Be sure you have ready at all times (a) another kind of birth control (such as condoms and spermicides) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills, and (b) an extra, full pill pack. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>You have a choice for which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your healthcare provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Day 1 Start: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>1. Take the first yellow pill of the pack during the first 24 hours of your period. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, because you are starting the Pill at the beginning of your period. However, if you start OCELLA later than the first day of your period, you should use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method until you have taken 7 yellow pills.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sunday Start: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>1. Take the first yellow pill of the pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. Use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). This also applies if you start OCELLA after having been pregnant and you have not had a period since your pregnancy. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots (see following graph), especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like OCELLA) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>It is not known if hormonal birth control pills cause breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking OCELLA. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long has you have taken the pills regularly on time. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills regularly on time, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking OCELLA if you are pregnant.</paragraph>
