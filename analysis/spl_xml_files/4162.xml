                     <text>
                        <paragraph>To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring must be used as directed <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_e8bbe088-63c1-452f-b915-36f5a4bdb842">2.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. One etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is inserted in the vagina. <content styleCode="bold">The ring is to remain in place continuously for three weeks.</content> It is removed for a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new ring is inserted one week after the last ring was removed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The user can choose the insertion position that is most comfortable to her, for example, standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. The ring is to be compressed and inserted into the vagina. The exact position of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring inside the vagina is not critical for its function. The vaginal ring must be inserted on the appropriate day and left in place for three consecutive weeks. This means that the ring should be removed three weeks later on the same day of the week as it was inserted and at about the same time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring can be removed by hooking the index finger under the forward rim or by grasping the rim between the index and middle finger and pulling it out. The used ring should be placed in the foil pouch, resealed with provided sticker, and discarded in a waste receptacle out of the reach of children and pets (do not flush in toilet).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs, a new ring is inserted on the same day of the week as it was inserted in the previous cycle. The withdrawal bleed usually starts on Day 2 to 3 after removal of the ring and may not have finished before the next ring is inserted. In order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness, the new ring must be inserted exactly one week after the previous one was removed even if menstrual bleeding has not finished.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring, with an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. It is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and magnesium stearate, and contains <br/> 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is not made with natural rubber latex.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Stop etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_0178f8ac-a85d-403a-aa95-816dd29368aa">6</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If feasible, stop etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Start etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#LINK_28e66f97-39e2-493a-bde5-03b3b8b399ba">4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two epidemiologic studies<sup>1, 2, 3</sup> that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring are described below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users had a risk of VTE similar to Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) users (see Table 1 for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the study<sup>*</sup> 8.2 events per 10,000 WY.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>_____________________________________<br/>
                           <sup>*</sup> Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of CHCs is well-established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non­users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins.

                        <paragraph>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration. Vaginal/cervical erosion or ulceration in women using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been reported. In some cases, the ring adhered to vaginal tissue, necessitating removal by a healthcare provider and in some instances (i.e., when the tissue had grown over the ring), removal was achieved by cutting the ring without incising the overlying vaginal tissue.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some women are aware of the ring on occasion during the 21 days of use or during intercourse, and sexual partners may feel etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in the vagina.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs.</paragraph>

                           </content>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated during pregnancy because there is no need for pregnancy prevention in a woman who is already pregnant. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not shown an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following maternal exposure to low dose CHCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the administration of etonogestrel during organogenesis at doses approximately 300 times the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the coadministration of the combination desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol during organogenesis at desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol doses at least 2/5 times, respectively, the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if pregnancy is confirmed.</paragraph>

                           </content>In rats and rabbits at dosages up to 300 times the anticipated dose, etonogestrel is neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Coadministration of a maternally toxic dose of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and wavy ribs at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 40/130 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose (0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day). No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rats at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 4/13 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. When desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol was given to pregnant rabbits, preimplantation loss was observed at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 3/10 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rabbits at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 2/5 times the anticipated vaginal human dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Small amounts of contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites, including etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are transferred to human milk. Harmful effects have not been observed in breastfed infants exposed to CHCs through breast milk. CHCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When possible, advise the nursing mother to use non-estrogen-containing contraception until she has completely weaned her child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring or from the underlying maternal condition. </paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring containing two active components, a progestin, etonogestrel (13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one) and an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (19-nor-17α-pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of  etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers (28% and 9% vinylacetate) and magnesium stearate and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is not made with natural rubber latex. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. The molecular weights for etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are 324.46 and 296.40, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary effect of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In three large one-year clinical trials enrolling 2,834 women aged 18-40 years, in North America, Europe, Brazil, and Chile, the racial distribution was 93% Caucasian, 5.0% Black, 0.8% Asian, and 1.2% Other. Women with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded from these studies.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on pooled data from the three trials, 2,356 women aged &lt; 35 years completed 23,515 evaluable cycles of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use (cycles in which no back-up contraception was used). The pooled pregnancy rate (Pearl Index) was 1.28 (95% CI [0.8, 1.9]) per 100 women-years of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use. In the US study, the Pearl Index was 2.02 (95% CI [1.1, 3.4]) per <br/> 100 women-years of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study data indicate the return of ovulation and spontaneous menstrual cycles in most women within a month after discontinuation of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring contains a combination of a progestin and estrogen, 2 kinds of female hormones. Birth control methods that contain both an estrogen and a progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on the results of a US clinical study, approximately 1 to 3 women out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is not known if hormonal birth control causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Women who use hormonal birth control methods may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>When you use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use, but may also occur after you have been using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the ring on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
