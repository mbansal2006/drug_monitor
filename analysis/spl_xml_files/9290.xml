Ototoxicity</title>

                        <paragraph>Caution should be exercised when prescribing tobramycin inhalation solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials. Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies. Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the tobramycin inhalation solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity. No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_46e3b84f-092a-45bc-8dca-1b5abb0ac981">6.2</linkHtml>)]</content>, onset of this symptom warrants caution. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution.</paragraph>

Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies.</content>

                        <paragraph>Nephrotoxicity was not seen during tobramycin inhalation solution clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Twenty-six (14%) tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 tobramycin inhalation solution patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution should have their renal function closely monitored.</paragraph>

Neuromuscular Disorders</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tobramycin inhalation solution should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients with normal renal function treated with tobramycin inhalation solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06 to 1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2918cb2b-1703-46cc-9d3e-43426ca8d455">12.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing.</paragraph>

Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician.</paragraph>

Clinical Trials Experience</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drugs cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure to tobramycin inhalation solution in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution ranged in age from 6 to 31 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug. All patients were ≤30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13 to 17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (&gt;17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with <content styleCode="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</content> while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with <content styleCode="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</content> during the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the tobramycin inhalation solution group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were ≤46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6 to 12 years old while 29% of patients were 13 to 17 years old. Only 30% were adults (&gt;17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with <content styleCode="italics">P. aeruginosa</content>. Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with <content styleCode="italics">P. aeruginosa</content> during the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both tobramycin inhalation solution- and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients and at rates ≥ 2% more common compared to the placebo-treated patients: decreased forced expiratory volume, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia (Table 1).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of tobramycin inhalation solution, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes. After four weeks of therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of an inhaled solution of tobramycin has been completed. Rats were exposed to tobramycin for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. Serum levels of tobramycin up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, 35x the average 1 mcg/mL exposure levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with five tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with <content styleCode="italics">P. aeruginosa</content>. The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to tobramycin inhalation solution over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with tobramycin inhalation solution. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed tobramycin inhalation solution and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted ≥40% and ≤80% (mean baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with <content styleCode="italics">P. aeruginosa</content>. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of ≥1.5 mg/dL, or who had <content styleCode="italics">Burkholderia cepacia</content> isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received tobramycin inhalation solution, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than <content styleCode="italics">P. aeruginosa</content>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive tobramycin inhalation solution (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were ≤30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis except for one patient who had missing baseline information.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 1 dosing in the primary analysis population. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted of 16% and 5%, respectively (LS mean difference = 11%; 95% CI: 3, 19; p=0.003). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted over eight weeks.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-cycle, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 247 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three cycles of tobramycin inhalation solution (n=161) or placebo (n=86). As in Study 1, each cycle comprised 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. All patients were ≤46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 44.9% were females. In this study, two randomized patients in the placebo group were not included in the primary efficacy analysis; one withdrew consent without taking any trial medication and the other withdrew due to an adverse drug reaction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Tobramycin inhalation solution significantly improved lung function compared with placebo as measured by the absolute change in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted from baseline to the end of Cycle 3 “ON” period. Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo resulted in absolute increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted of 7% and 1%, respectively (LS mean difference = 6%; 95% CI: 3, 10; p&lt;0.001). This analysis is adjusted for the covariate of baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted, using multiple imputation for missing data. Figure 1 shows the average change in FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted over 24 weeks from Study 2.</paragraph>

Storage Instructions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>You should store tobramycin inhalation solution ampules in a refrigerator (36° to 46°F or 2° to 8°C). However, when you don’t have a refrigerator available (e.g., transporting your tobramycin inhalation solution), you may store the foil pouches (opened or unopened) at room temperature (up to 77°F/25°C) for up to 28 days.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tobramycin inhalation solution is light sensitive; unopened ampules should be returned to the foil pouch. Avoid exposing tobramycin inhalation solution ampules to intense light. Unrefrigerated tobramycin inhalation solution, which is normally colorless to yellow, may darken with age; however, the color change does not indicate any change in the quality of the product.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You should not use tobramycin inhalation solution if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days. You should not use tobramycin inhalation solution beyond the expiration date stamped on the ampule.</paragraph>
