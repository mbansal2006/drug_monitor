These adverse reactions occurred primarily in patients with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with a history of CHF, 12.7% (15/118) of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 4.8% (5/104) of placebo-treated patients had the serious adverse reaction of heart failure during the 12-week study period <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Additionally, in patients with a history of CHF, there were more deaths in ZINPLAVA-treated patients, 19.5% (23/118) than in placebo-treated patients, 12.5% (13/104) during the 12-week study period. The causes of death varied and included cardiac failure, infections, and respiratory failure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of ZINPLAVA was evaluated in two placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (Trial 1 n=390 and Trial 2 n=396). Patients received a single 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion of ZINPLAVA and concomitant standard of care (SoC) antibacterial drugs (metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin) for CDI. Adverse reactions reported within the first 4 weeks after ZINPLAVA was administered are described for the pooled Phase 3 trial population of 786 patients. The median age of patients receiving ZINPLAVA was 65 years (range 18 to 100), 50% were age 65 years or older, 56% were female, and 83% were white.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Overall, 10% of ZINPLAVA-treated patients experienced one or more infusion specific adverse reactions on the day of, or the day after, the infusion compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. Infusion specific adverse reactions reported in â‰¥0.5% of patients receiving ZINPLAVA and at a frequency greater than placebo were nausea (3%), fatigue (1%), pyrexia (1%), dizziness (1%), headache (2%), dyspnea (1%) and hypertension (1%). Of these patients, 78% and 20% of patients experienced mild and moderate adverse reactions, respectively. These reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The safety and pharmacokinetics of ZINPLAVA in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial (Trial 3). Enrolled patients had a diagnosis of CDI and received SoC (vancomycin, metronidazole, or fidaxomicin) for the baseline CDI episode. In this trial, 143 patients were randomized and treated, of whom 107 received a single infusion of ZINPLAVA (10 mg/kg) and 36 received a placebo infusion. Of these randomized patients, 58% were 1 to &lt;12 years of age, 52% were male, 80% were white, and 7% were multi-racial. The majority (94%) of patients had one or more risk factors for CDI recurrence. <content styleCode="italics">[See <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>.]</content>

                              <paragraph>The adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adult patients. Five of 107 pediatric patients (5%) receiving ZINPLAVA and one of 36 pediatric patients receiving placebo (3%) died in Trial 3. There were no treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 10% of pediatric patients treated with ZINPLAVA were pyrexia (19 patients, 18%) and headache (15 patients, 14%). One ZINPLAVA-treated pediatric patient (1%) experienced an infusion-related adverse reaction.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab were studied in 1515 adult CDI patients in two Phase 3 trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2). Based on a population PK analysis, the geometric mean (%CV) clearance of bezlotoxumab was 0.317 L/day (41%), with a mean volume of distribution of 7.33 L (16%), and elimination half-life (tÂ½) of approximately 19 days (28%). After a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg ZINPLAVA, geometric mean AUC<sub>0-INF</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were 53000 mcgâˆ™h/mL and 185 mcg/mL, respectively, in the adult patients with CDI. The clearance of bezlotoxumab increased with increasing body weight; the resulting exposure differences are adequately addressed by the administration of a weight-based dose. Bezlotoxumab is eliminated by catabolism.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ZINPLAVA were investigated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in patients receiving Standard of Care antibacterial drugs for treatment of CDI (SoC).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Randomization was stratified by SoC (metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin) and hospitalization status (inpatient vs. outpatient) at the time of study entry.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Enrolled patients were 18 years of age or older and had a confirmed diagnosis of CDI, which was defined as diarrhea (passage of 3 or more loose bowel movements in 24 or fewer hours) and a positive stool test for toxigenic <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile</content> from a stool sample collected no more than 7 days before study entry. Patients were excluded if surgery for CDI was planned, or if they had uncontrolled chronic diarrheal illness. Patients received a 10- to 14-day course of oral SoC and a single infusion of ZINPLAVA or placebo was administered during the course of SoC. Patients on oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin could have also received intravenous metronidazole. Choice of SoC was at the discretion of the health care provider. The day of the infusion of ZINPLAVA or placebo in relation to the start of SoC ranged from the day prior to the start of SoC to 14 days after the start of SoC with the median being day 3 of SoC.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In Trial 1, 403 patients were randomized to receive ZINPLAVA and 404 patients were randomized to receive placebo. In Trial 2, 407 subjects were randomized to receive ZINPLAVA and 399 patients were randomized to receive placebo. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was a subset of all randomized subjects with exclusions for: (i) not receiving infusion of study medication; (ii) not having a positive local stool test for toxigenic <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile</content>; (iii) not receiving protocol defined standard of care therapy within a 1 day window of the infusion. The baseline characteristics of the 1554 patients randomized to ZINPLAVA or placebo in the FAS were similar across treatment arms and in Trial 1 and Trial 2. The median age was 65 years, 85% were white, 57% were female, and 68% were inpatients. A similar proportion of patients received oral metronidazole (48%) or oral vancomycin (48%) and 4% of the patients received oral fidaxomicin as their SoC.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The following risk factors associated with a high risk of CDI recurrence or CDI-related adverse outcomes were present in the study population: 51% were â‰¥65 years of age, 39% received one or more systemic antibacterial drugs (during the 12-week follow-up period), 28% had one or more episodes of CDI within the six months prior to the episode under treatment (15% had two or more episodes prior to the episode under treatment), 21% were immunocompromised and 16% presented at study entry with clinically severe CDI (as defined by a Zar score of â‰¥2<sup>1</sup>). A hypervirulent strain (ribotypes 027, 078 or 244) was isolated in 22% of patients who had a positive baseline culture, of which 87% (189 of 217 strains) were ribotype 027.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients were assessed for clinical cure of the presenting CDI episode, defined as no diarrhea for 2 consecutive days following the completion of a â‰¤14 day SoC regimen. Patients who achieved clinical cure were then assessed for recurrence of CDI through 12 weeks following administration of the infusion of ZINPLAVA or placebo. CDI recurrence was defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhea associated with a positive stool test for toxigenic <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile</content> following clinical cure of the presenting CDI episode. Sustained clinical response was defined as clinical cure of the presenting CDI episode and no CDI recurrence through 12 weeks after infusion. Table 2 contains the results for Trial 1 and Trial 2.</paragraph>

ZINPLAVA should only be used along with the antibiotic that you are taking to treat C-diff. Keep taking your antibiotic for your C-diff as directed by your doctor.<br/>It is not known if ZINPLAVA is safe and effective in children under 1 year of age.
