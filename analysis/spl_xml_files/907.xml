                     <title>5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In both genders of rats, exenatide extended-release caused a dose-related and treatment-durationâdependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures compared to controls  <content styleCode="italics">[see<linkHtml href="#S13.1"> Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. A statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in female rats receiving exenatide extended-release at 27-times clinical exposure compared to controls and higher incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at â¥2-times clinical exposure. The potential of exenatide extended-release to induce C-cell tumors in mice has not been evaluated. Other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have also induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether BYDUREON BCISE will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as the human relevance of exenatide extended-release-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>BYDUREON BCISE is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with the use of BYDUREON BCISE and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with BYDUREON BCISE. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have values &gt;50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serious bleeding, which may be fatal, from drug-induced immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has been reported in the postmarketing setting with exenatide use. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated reaction with exenatide-dependent anti-platelet antibodies. In the presence of exenatide, these antibodies cause platelet destruction. If drug-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, discontinue BYDUREON BCISE immediately and do not re-expose the patient to exenatide. Upon discontinuation, thrombocytopenia can persist due to the prolonged exenatide exposure from BYDUREON BCISE (about 10 weeks) <content styleCode="italics">[see </content>

Overall, there were 526 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg with a mean duration of exposure of 35 weeks in the controlled and extension phases of the two trials. Across the treatment arms in the controlled periods, the mean age of patients was 55 years, 2% were 75 years or older and 59% were male.

                        <paragraph>Limited data with exenatide, the active ingredient in BYDUREON BCISE, in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</content>. Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to BYDUREON BCISE during pregnancy. BYDUREON BCISE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes from exposure to exenatide extended-release during pregnancy or from exposure to exenatide during pregnancy and lactation, in association with maternal effects. In rats, exenatide extended-release, administered during the period of organogenesis, reduced fetal growth and produced skeletal ossification deficits at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 mg/week. In mice, exenatide administered during gestation and lactation, caused increased neonatal deaths at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the MRHD <content styleCode="italics">(see Data</content>). Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &gt;10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregnant rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg exenatide extended-release every 3 days during organogenesis had systemic exposures 3-, 8-, and 19-times human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 2 mg/week BYDUREON BCISE based on plasma exenatide exposure (AUC) comparison. Reduced fetal growth at all doses and skeletal ossification deficits at 1 and 3 mg/kg occurred at doses that decreased maternal food intake and body weight gain.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In studies evaluating reproduction and development in pregnant mice and rabbits, maternal animals were administered exenatide, the active ingredient in BYDUREON BCISE, by subcutaneous injection twice a day. Differences in embryofetal developmental toxicity from subcutaneously injected exenatide extended-release and exenatide were not evaluated in mice, rats, or rabbits.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pregnant mice given 6, 68, 460, or 760 mcg/kg/day exenatide during fetal organogenesis, skeletal variations associated with slowed fetal growth, including changes in number of rib pairs or vertebral ossifications sites, and wavy ribs were observed at 760 mcg/kg/day, a dose that produced maternal toxicity and yielded systemic exposure 200-times the human exposure resulting from the MRHD of BYDUREON BCISE based on AUC comparison.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pregnant rabbits given 0.2, 2, 22, 156, or 260 mcg/kg/day exenatide during fetal organogenesis, irregular fetal skeletal ossifications were observed at 2 mcg/kg/day, a dose yielding systemic exposure up to 6-times the human exposure from the MRHD of BYDUREON BCISE based on AUC comparison.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In maternal mice given 6, 68, or 760 mcg/kg/day exenatide from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 (weaning), an increased number of neonatal deaths at 6 mcg/kg/day were observed on postpartum days 2 to 4 in dams given 6 mcg/kg/day, a dose yielding a systemic exposure equivalent to the human exposure from the MRHD of BYDUREON BCISE based on AUC comparison.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>BYDUREON BCISE (exenatide) extended-release injectable suspension is a GLP-1 receptor agonist supplied as a sterile suspension of exenatide extended-release microspheres in an oil-based vehicle of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), in a single-dose autoinjector. Redispersion by mixing provides a white to off-white, opaque, suspension to be administered by subcutaneous injection. Each autoinjector contains sufficient suspension to deliver 2 mg of exenatide extended-release in a volume of 0.85 mL.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Exenatide is a 39-amino acid synthetic peptide amide with an empirical formula of C<sub>184</sub>H<sub>282</sub>N<sub>50</sub>O<sub>60</sub>S and a molecular weight of 4186.6 Daltons. The amino acid sequence for exenatide is shown below.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>H-His-Gly-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Leu-Ser-Lys-Gln-Met-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Val-Arg-Leu-Phe-Ile-Glu-Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-NH<sub>2</sub>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Exenatide is incorporated in an extended-release microsphere formulation containing the 50:50 poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer (37.2 mg per dose) along with sucrose (0.8 mg per dose), suspended in the vehicle, MCT (774.4 mg per dose).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Incretins, such as GLP-1, enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The amino acid sequence of exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been shown to bind and activate the human GLP-1 receptor <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. This leads to an increase in both glucose-dependent synthesis of insulin and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells, by mechanisms involving cyclic AMP and/or other intracellular signaling pathways. Exenatide promotes insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations.</paragraph>

The upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on population correction method (QTcP) was below 10 ms. Therefore, exenatide was not associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Following a single subcutaneous dose of exenatide microspheres suspended in MCT-oil, there is an initial period of release of surface-bound exenatide followed by a gradual release of exenatide from the microspheres, which results in a peak of plasma exenatide concentration at around Week 6 to Week 7 representing the hydration and erosion of the microspheres.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Following initiation of once every 7 days (weekly) administration of 2 mg BYDUREON BCISE, a gradual increase in the plasma exenatide concentration is observed up to approximately Week 10. From Week 10 mean plasma exenatide concentrations of approximately 208 pg/mL were maintained over once every 7 days (weekly) dosing intervals indicating that steady-state was achieved.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration with subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide in humans is 9.1 L/hour and is independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks after discontinuation of BYDUREON BCISE therapy, plasma exenatide concentrations generally fall below the minimal quantifiable concentration of 20 pg/mL.</paragraph>

Repeated daily doses of the oral contraceptive (OC) given 30 minutes after BYETTA administration decreased the C<sub>max</sub> of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 45% and 27%, respectively, and delayed the T<sub>max</sub> of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 3.0 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively, as compared to the oral contraceptive administered alone. Administration of repeated daily doses of the OC one hour prior to BYETTA administration decreased the mean C<sub>max</sub> of ethinyl estradiol by 15%, but the mean C<sub>max</sub> of levonorgestrel was not significantly changed as compared to when the OC was given alone. BYETTA did not alter the mean trough concentrations of levonorgestrel after repeated daily dosing of the oral contraceptive for both regimens. However, the mean trough concentration of ethinyl estradiol was increased by 20% when the OC was administered 30 minutes after BYETTA administration injection as compared to when the OC was given alone. The effect of BYETTA on OC pharmacokinetics is confounded by the possible food effect on OC in this study <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_7_DRUG_INTERACTIONS">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 2âyear carcinogenicity study was conducted with exenatide extended-release, the active component of BYDUREON BCISE, in male and female rats at doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg (2-, 10-, and 27-times human systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 mg/week. BYDUREON BCISE based on plasma exenatide AUC, respectively) administered by subcutaneous injection every other week. In this study there was an increased incidence of C-cell adenomas and C-cell carcinomas at all doses.

Treatment with BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg once weekly (QW) resulted in a statistically significantly greater reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared to BYETTA 10 mcg twice daily. The mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was non-inferior compared with BYETTA 10 mcg twice daily at the pre-specified non-inferiority margin +0.4% in this study. BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg QW was statistically superior to BYETTA 10 mcg twice daily (ANCOVA p-value=0.0032).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportions of subjects achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;7.0% at Week 28 were 40% in BYDUREON BCISE group compared to 38% in BYETTA group. Subjects with missing values at Week 28 counted as non-responders. The mean changes from baseline to Week 28 for fasting plasma glucose were -36 mg/dL and -27 mg/dL for BYDUREON BCISE and BYETTA, respectively, and for body weight were -1.4 kg and -1.9 kg for BYDUREON BCISE and BYETTA, respectively.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>BYDUREON, another exenatide extended-release product, has been studied as monotherapy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">BYDUREON Monotherapy versus Metformin, Sitagliptin, and Pioglitazone </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 26-week, randomized, comparator-controlled trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of BYDUREON to metformin, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate with diet and exercise (Trial 3 - NCT00676338). Patients were randomly assigned to receive BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once every seven days (weekly), titrated metformin from 1000 to 2500 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day or titrated pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg/day, all dosed according to approved labeling.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 820 patients were studied: 552 (67%) were White, 102 (12%) were East Asian, 71 (9%) were West Asian, 65 (8%) were Hispanic or Latino, 25 (3.0%) were Black or African American, 4 (0.5%) were of Native American ethnicity, and 1 was classified otherwise. The mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.5%. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to Week 26 (or the last value at time of early discontinuation). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Efficacy Results:</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with BYDUREON 2 mg once weekly (QW) resulted in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction that was statistically significantly greater compared to sitagliptin 100 mg/day. The mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was non-inferior compared with metformin 1000-2500 mg/day (mean dose 2077 mg/day at study endpoint). Non-inferiority of BYDUREON 2 mg QW to pioglitazone 30-45 mg/day (mean dose 40 mg/day at study endpoint) in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 weeks of treatment was not demonstrated (the mean change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 weeks was -1.6% with BYDUREON and -1.7% with pioglitazone). The non-inferiority margin was set at +0.3% in this study. The results for the primary endpoint at 26 weeks are summarized in Table 6. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients with a Week 26 value achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> of less than 7% at Week 26 were 56%, 52%, 40%, and 55% for BYDUREON, metformin, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone, respectively. Patients who did achieve HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal &lt;7% and discontinued before Week 26 were not included as responders. The mean changes from baseline to Week 26 for fasting serum glucose were -41 mg/dL, -36 mg/dL, -20 mg/dL and -46 mg/dL, and for body weight were -2.0 kg, -2.0 kg, -0.8 kg and +1.5 kg for BYDUREON, metformin, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>BYDUREON, another exenatide extended-release product, has been studied in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and basal insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 26-week double-blind comparator-controlled trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of BYDUREON to sitagliptin and pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate with metformin therapy (Trial 4 - NCT00637273). Patients were randomly assigned to receive BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once every 7 days (weekly), sitagliptin 100 mg/day or pioglitazone 45 mg/day, in addition to their existing metformin therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 491 patients were studied 168 (34.2%) were White, 143 (29.1%) were Hispanic or Latino, 119 (24.2%) were Asian, 52 (10.6%) were Black or African American, 3 (0.6%) were of Native American ethnicity, and 6 (1.2%) were classified otherwise. The mean baseline HbA1c was 8.5%. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to Week 26 (or the last value at time of early discontinuation). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, treatment with BYDUREON 2 mg QW resulted in a statistically significant mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction compared to sitagliptin 100 mg/day. There was a numerically greater reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with BYDUREON compared to pioglitazone, but there was not sufficient evidence to conclude superiority of BYDUREON 2 mg QW to pioglitazone 45 mg/day in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 Weeks of treatment. Results for the primary endpoint at 26 Weeks are summarized in Table 7. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients with a Week 26 value achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> of less than 7% at Week 26 were 46%, 30%, and 39% for BYDUREON, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone, respectively. Patients who did achieve an HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal &lt;7% and discontinued before Week 26 were not included as responders. The mean changes from baseline to Week 26 for fasting serum glucose were -32 mg/dL, -16 mg/dL and -27 mg/dL, and for body weight were -2.3 kg, -0.8 kg and +2.8 kg for BYDUREON, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 26-week open-label comparator-controlled trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of BYDUREON to titrated insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate with metformin or metformin plus sulfonylurea therapy (Trial 5 - NCT00641056). Patients were randomly assigned to receive BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once every 7 days (weekly) or insulin glargine once daily in addition to their existing oral antidiabetic therapy. Insulin glargine was dosed to a target fasting glucose concentration of 72 to 100 mg/dL. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean dose of insulin glargine was 10 units/day at baseline and 31 units/day at endpoint. At Week 26, 21% of insulin glargine-treated patients were at fasting glucose goal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 456 patients were studied: 379 (83.1%) were White, 47 (10.3%) were Hispanic or Latino, 25 (5.5%) were East Asian, 3 (0.7%) were Black or African American, and 2 (0.4%) were of West Asian ethnicity. Background therapy was either metformin (70%) or metformin plus sulfonylurea (30%). The mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.3%. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to Week 26 (or the last value at time of early discontinuation). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Treatment with BYDUREON once weekly resulted in a mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline at 26 weeks of -1.5%. The mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> seen in insulin glargine arm at 26 weeks was -1.3%. The difference in observed effect size between BYDUREON and glargine in this trial excluded the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of +0.3%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients with a Week 26 value achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> of less than 7% at Week 26 were 57% and 48% for BYDUREON and insulin glargine, respectively. Patients who did achieve an HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal &lt;7% and discontinued before Week 26 were not included as responders. The mean changes from baseline to Week 26 for fasting serum glucose in this study were -38 mg/dL and -50 mg/dL, and for body weight were -2.6 kg and +1.4 kg for BYDUREON and insulin glargine, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 26-week open-label comparator-controlled trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of BYDUREON to liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate with metformin, a sulfonylurea, metformin plus sulfonylurea, or metformin plus pioglitazone therapy (Trial 6 - NCT01029886). Patients were randomly assigned to receive BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once every 7 days (weekly) or liraglutide uptitrated from 0.6 mg/day to 1.2 mg/day, then 1.8 mg/day in addition to their existing oral antidiabetic therapy. Each titration was to be completed after at least one week, but could be delayed if the patient had severe nausea or vomiting as established by the investigator. Patients not tolerating the 1.8 mg/day dose of liraglutide by Week 4 were discontinued from the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 911 patients were studied: 753 (82.7%) were White, 111 (12.2%) were Asian, 32 (3.5%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 8 (0.9%) were of Black or African American ethnicity, 6 (0.7%) were multiple races, and 1 (0.1%) was Pacific Islander. Background therapy was either a single oral antidiabetic agent (35%) or a combination of oral antidiabetic agents (65%). The mean baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.4%. </paragraph>

                     <title>14.5 EXSCEL Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>EXSCEL was a multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group pragmatic study that evaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with BYDUREON (exenatide) for extended-release injectable suspension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care (NCT01144338).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 14,752 adult patients were randomized 1:1 to either BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once weekly or placebo and followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median treatment duration of 27.8 months. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ninety six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the protocol, and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the BYDUREON and placebo group, respectively. The mean age at study entry was 62 years (21 to 92 years with 8.5% of the patients â¥75 years). Approximately 62.0% of the patients were male, 75.8% were White, 9.8% were Asian, 6.0% were Black or African American, and 20.5% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] â¥60 to â¤89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR â¥30 to â¤59 mL/min/1.73 m2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.1%. At baseline, 1.5% of patients were not treated with either oral antidiabetic medications or insulin, 42.3% were treated with one oral antidiabetic medication and 42.4% were treated with two or more oral antidiabetic medications. Usage of oral antidiabetic medications included metformin (76.6%), sulfonylurea (36.6%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (14.9%), thiazolidinediones (3.9%), and SGLT2 inhibitors (0.9%). Overall insulin usage was 46.3% (13.8% with insulin alone and 32.6% with insulin and one or more oral antidiabetic medications).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Overall, at baseline, 26.9% of patients did not have established cardiovascular (CV) disease, while 73.1% had established CV disease. The concomitant use of CV medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antithrombotic and anticoagulants, and lipid-lowering agents) was similar in the BYDUREON and placebo groups. At baseline, the mean systolic blood pressure was 135.5 mmHg, the mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.1 mmHg, the mean LDL was 95.0 mg/dL, and the mean HDL was 44.0 mg/dL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) from randomization. MACE was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular (CV)-related death, or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality, CV-related death, and fatal or nonfatal MI or stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure were also assessed as secondary endpoints.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type-1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>BYDUREON did not increase the risk of MACE in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; P&lt;0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.06 for superiority). See results in Table 10 and Figure 2. The incidence of MACE in patients with and without established CV disease was 13.4% in the BYDUREON group versus 14.6% in the placebo group and 6.0% (BYDUREON) versus 5.9% (placebo), respectively. Five hundred and seven (507) patients (6.9%) died in the BYDUREON group versus 584 (7.9%) in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.6 Glycemic Control Trial in Pediatric Patients 10 Years of Age and Older with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once weekly or placebo was evaluated in a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Trial 9 - NCT01554618) in 82 patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. This study included a 28-week open-label long-term extension in which patients in both treatment groups received BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once weekly after the 24-week controlled period.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this trial, 88% of patients completed the assessment period. The mean age at study entry was 15.1 years (13% were 11 to 12 years old, 59% were 13 to 16 years old and 28% were older than 16 years). Approximately 42% of the patients were male, 43% were White, 4% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, 6% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 44% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean body weight was 100.6 kg (67% were in â¥97 weight percentile group, 26% in â¥85 to &lt;97 and 6% in â¥3 to &lt;85), mean BMI was 36.4 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 2.3 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.17%, 12.2% of patients were not treated with either oral antidiabetic medications or insulin, 40.2% were treated with one oral antidiabetic medication and 1.2% were treated with two oral antidiabetic medications. 79.3% of patients were receiving metformin and 1.2% were receiving sulfonylurea. Overall insulin usage was 46.3% (8.5% with insulin alone and 37.8% with insulin and one other oral antidiabetic medication).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint of the study was the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to Week 24.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>BYDUREON was superior to placebo in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> (Table 11). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean changes from baseline to Week 24 for body weight were -0.17 kg with (SE 0.7) and +0.88 kg (SE 1.0) for BYDUREON and placebo, respectively.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">1. Where is the needle?</content>
                     <br/>The needle is attached to the autoinjector and covered by the orange cap.<br/>When you unscrew the orange cap, the green shield keeps the needle covered until you inject.<br/>For more information, please see Figure N in Step 3B in the Instructions for Use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">2. How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed?</content>
                     <br/>After shaking the autoinjector, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine along the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the autoinjector hard until the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even throughout.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">3. Why do I need to hold the autoinjector upright while removing the orange cap?<br/>
                     </content>Holding the autoinjector with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal to see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">4. Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it?<br/>
                     </content>If you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will not get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your autoinjector is in the locked position. However, after you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. You cannot save it for later use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">5. How do I know I gave myself the full dose of medicine?<br/>
                     </content>To be sure you get your full dose, press and hold the autoinjector against your skin.<br/>You will feel the needle go into your skin. Hold the needle against your skin for 15 seconds. This will allow enough time for all the medicine to go from the autoinjector to under your skin. After removing the needle, look for the orange rod in the window as a way to tell that the dose has been given. If the orange rod does not appear contact Customer Service at 1-800-236-9933.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">6. Why should I store my autoinjectors flat in the refrigerator?</content>
                     <br/>Autoinjectors stored vertically (with the needle up or down) are more difficult to mix. The medicine can still be fully mixed, but it will take more shaking and more time.</paragraph>
