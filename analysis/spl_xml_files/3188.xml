                  <paragraph>Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase.  Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication.  Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.  When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues.</paragraph>

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, effects of methotrexate on articular swelling and tenderness can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks.  Although methotrexate clearly ameliorates symptoms of inflammation (pain, swelling, stiffness), there is no evidence that it induces remission of rheumatoid arthritis nor has a beneficial effect been demonstrated on bone erosions and other radiologic changes which result in impaired joint use, functional disability, and deformity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Most studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are relatively short-term (3 to 6 months).  Limited data from long-term studies indicate that an initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin.  This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as a part of the treatment of patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.  The original rationale for high-dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin.  More recent evidence suggests that high-dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport, decreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of dihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglutamation of methotrexate.  The actual mechanism of action is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 127 pediatric patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (mean age, 10.1 years; age range, 2.5 to 18 years; mean duration of disease, 5.1 years) on background non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone, methotrexate given weekly at an oral dose of 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> provided significant clinical improvement compared to placebo as measured by either the physician’s global assessment, or by a patient composite (25% reduction in the articular-severity score plus improvement in parent and physician global assessments of disease activity).  Over two-thirds of the patients in this trial had polyarticular-course JRA, and the numerically greatest response was seen in this subgroup treated with 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/wk methotrexate. The overwhelming majority of the remaining patients had systemic-course JRA.  All patients were unresponsive to NSAIDs; approximately one-third were using low-dose corticosteroids. Weekly methotrexate at a dose of 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was not significantly more effective than placebo in this trial.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two Pediatric Oncology Group studies (one randomized and one non-randomized) demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival in patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma, when high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents following surgical resection of the primary tumor.  These studies were not designed to demonstrate the specific contribution of high-dose methotrexate/leucovorin rescue therapy to the efficacy of the combination.  However, a contribution can be inferred from the reports of objective responses to this therapy in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma, and from reports of extensive tumor necrosis following preoperative administration of this therapy to patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral absorption appears to be dose dependent.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 0.75 to 6.0 hours following oral administration.  At doses of 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or less, methotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60%.  The absorption of doses greater than 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> is significantly less, possibly due to a saturation effect.  
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In leukemic pediatric patients, oral absorption of methotrexate also appears to be dose dependent and has been reported to vary widely (23% to 95%).  A twenty fold difference between highest and lowest peak levels (C<sub>max</sub>: 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar after a 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose) has been reported.  Significant interindividual variability has also been noted in time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>: 0.67 to 4 hrs after a 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose) and fraction of dose absorbed.  The absorption of doses greater than 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> has been reported to be significantly less than that of lower doses.  Food has been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration.  Methotrexate is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of injection.  After intramuscular injection, peak serum concentrations occur in 30 to 60 minutes.  As in leukemic pediatric patients, a wide interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations of methotrexate has been reported in pediatric patients with JRA.  Following oral administration of methotrexate in doses of 6.4 to 11.2 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week in pediatric patients with JRA, mean serum concentrations were 0.59 micromolar (range, 0.03 to 1.4) at 1 hour, 0.44 micromolar (range, 0.01 to 1) at 2 hours, and 0.29 micromolar (range, 0.06 to 0.58) at 3 hours.  In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphocytic leukemia (6.3 to 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), or for JRA (3.75 to 26.2 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from 0.7 to 5.8 hours or 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively.

                        <paragraph>Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given orally or parenterally.  High CSF concentrations of the drug may be attained by intrathecal administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In dogs, synovial fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed than uninflamed joints.  Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration, prior prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level of normal joints.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues and tumors.  A small amount of metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate may occur at doses commonly prescribed.  Accumulation of this metabolite may become significant at the high doses used in osteogenic sarcoma.  The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3 to 5 fold lower than the parent compound.  Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration.  With IV administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.  There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose.  Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  Non-linear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg.  Impaired renal function, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels.  Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses.  Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity.  It has been postulated that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved. When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, a third space effusion, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The potential for toxicity from high-dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate plasma elimination.  Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustments of leucovorin dosing.  Guidelines for monitoring serum methotrexate levels, and for adjustment of leucovorin dosing to reduce the risk of methotrexate toxicity, are provided below in

                        <paragraph>Patients undergoing methotrexate therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly.  Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray. During therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months.  More frequent monitoring is usually indicated during antineoplastic therapy.

                     <title>Drug Interactions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate, such as used in the treatment of osteosarcoma.  Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate.  These drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have usually included concurrent use of constant dosage regimens of NSAIDs, without apparent problems.  It should be appreciated, however, that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis and that larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be increased because of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and sulfonamides.  Renal tubular transport is also diminished by probenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma, caution must be exercised if high-dose methotrexate is administered in combination with a potentially nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., cisplatin).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methotrexate increases the plasma levels of mercaptopurine.  The combination of methotrexate and mercaptopurine may therefore require dose adjustment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable broad spectrum antibiotics, may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with high- and low-dose methotrexate.  Use of methotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The potential for increased hepatotoxicity when methotrexate is administered with other hepatotoxic agents has not been evaluated.  However, hepatotoxicity has been reported in such cases.  Therefore, patients receiving concomitant therapy with methotrexate and other potential hepatotoxins (e.g., azathioprine, retinoids, sulfasalazine) should be closely monitored for possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methotrexate may decrease the clearance of theophylline; theophylline levels should be monitored when used concurrently with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Vitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease responses to systemically administered methotrexate.  Preliminary animal and human studies have shown that small quantities of intravenously administered leucovorin enter the CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and, in humans, remain 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration.  However, high doses of leucovorin may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Folate deficiency states may increase methotrexate toxicity.  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression in patients receiving methotrexate, probably by decreased tubular secretion and/or an additive antifolate effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, resulting in the potential for increased toxicity such as stomatitis, myelosuppression, and neurotoxicity. Avoid concomitant nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Use caution when administering methotrexate after a recent history of nitrous oxide administration.

                        <paragraph>No controlled human data exist regarding the risk of neoplasia with methotrexate.  Methotrexate has been evaluated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential with inconclusive results.  Although there is evidence that methotrexate causes chromosomal damage to animal somatic cells and human bone marrow cells, the clinical significance remains uncertain.  Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate.  However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment.  Benefits should be weighed against the potential risk before using methotrexate alone or in combination with other drugs, especially in pediatric patients or young adults.  Methotrexate causes embryotoxicity, abortion, and fetal defects in humans.  It has also been reported to cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction in humans, during and for a short period after cessation of therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Methotrexate has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity.  Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams.  In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes and advanced age.  An accurate incidence rate has not been determined; the rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known.  Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired hepatic function. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In psoriasis, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy.  The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy (2 to 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each additional 1 to 1.5 grams.  Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months.  Milder histologic findings such as fatty change and low-grade portal inflammation, are relatively common pretherapy.  Although these mild changes are usually not a reason to avoid or discontinue methotrexate therapy, the drug should be used with caution. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rheumatoid arthritis, age at first use of methotrexate and duration of therapy have been reported as risk factors for hepatotoxicity; other risk factors, similar to those observed in psoriasis, may be present in rheumatoid arthritis but have not been confirmed to date. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in this population.  There is a combined reported experience in 217 rheumatoid arthritis patients with liver biopsies both before and during treatment (after a cumulative dose of at least 1.5 g) and in 714 patients with a biopsy only during treatment.  There are 64 (7%) cases of fibrosis and 1 (0.1%) case of cirrhosis.  Of the 64 cases of fibrosis, 60 were deemed mild. The reticulin stain is more sensitive for early fibrosis and its use may increase these figures.  It is unknown whether even longer use will increase these risks. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Liver function tests should be performed at baseline at 4 to 8 week intervals in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Pretreatment liver biopsy should be performed for patients with a history of excessive alcohol consumption, persistently abnormal baseline liver function test values or chronic hepatitis B or C infection.  During therapy, liver biopsy should be performed if there are persistent liver function test abnormalities or there is a decrease in serum albumin below the normal range (in the setting of well controlled rheumatoid arthritis). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the results of a liver biopsy show mild changes (Roenigk, grades I, II, IIIa), methotrexate may be continued and the patient monitored as per recommendations listed above.  Methotrexate should be discontinued in any patient who displays persistently abnormal liver function tests and refuses liver biopsy or in any patient whose liver biopsy shows moderate to severe changes (Roenigk grade IIIb or IV). </paragraph>

Serious neurotoxicity, frequently manifested as generalized or focal seizures, has been reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermediate-dose intravenous methotrexate (1 gm/m<sup>2</sup>).   Symptomatic patients were commonly noted to have leukoencephalopathy and/or microangiopathic calcifications on diagnostic imaging studies.  Chronic leukoencephalopathy has also been reported in patients who received repeated doses of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue even without cranial irradiation.  Discontinuation of methotrexate does not always result in complete recovery.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There are no recent placebo-controlled trials in patients with psoriasis.  There are two literature reports (Roenigk, 1969, and Nyfors, 1978) describing large series (n=204, 248) of psoriasis patients treated with methotrexate.  Dosages ranged up to 25 mg per week and treatment was administered for up to four years. With the exception of alopecia, photosensitivity, and “burning of skin lesions” (each 3% to 10%), the adverse reaction rates in these reports were very similar to those in the rheumatoid arthritis studies.  Rarely, painful plaque erosions may appear (Pearce, HP and Wilson, BB:

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Leucovorin is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effect of inadvertently administered overdosages of methotrexate.  Leucovorin administration should begin as promptly as possible.  As the time interval between methotrexate administration and leucovorin initiation increases, the effectiveness of leucovorin in counteracting toxicity decreases.  Monitoring of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In cases of massive overdosage, hydration and urinary alkalinization may be necessary to prevent the precipitation of methotrexate and/or its metabolites in the renal tubules.  Generally speaking, neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis has been shown to improve methotrexate elimination.  However, effective clearance of methotrexate has been reported with acute, intermittent hemodialysis using a high-flux dialyzer (Wall, SM et al:

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Accidental intrathecal overdosage may require intensive systemic support, high-dose systemic leucovorin, alkaline diuresis and rapid CSF drainage and ventriculolumbar perfusion. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In post-marketing experience, overdose with methotrexate has generally occurred with oral and intrathecal administration, although intravenous and intramuscular overdose have also been reported. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reports of oral overdose often indicate accidental daily administration instead of weekly (single or divided doses).  Symptoms commonly reported following oral overdose include those symptoms and signs reported at pharmacologic doses, particularly hematologic and gastrointestinal reaction.  For example, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow suppression, mucositis, stomatitis, oral ulceration, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding.  In some cases, no symptoms were reported.  There have been reports of death following overdose.  In these cases, events such as sepsis or septic shock, renal failure, and aplastic anemia were also reported. 
       
 
  <br/>
                     <br/>Symptoms of intrathecal overdose are generally central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, including headache, nausea and vomiting, seizure or convulsion, and acute toxic encephalopathy.  In some cases, no symptoms were reported.  There have been reports of death following intrathecal overdose.  In these cases, cerebellar herniation associated with increased intracranial pressure, and acute toxic encephalopathy have also been reported. 
       
 
  <br/>
                     <br/>Glucarpidase is indicated for the treatment of toxic methotrexate concentrations in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function (refer to the glucarpidase prescribing information).  If glucarpidase is used, do not administer leucovorin within two hours before or after a dose of glucarpidase because leucovorin is a substrate for glucarpidase.  There are published case reports of intravenous and intrathecal glucarpidase treatment to hasten clearance of methotrexate in cases of overdose.

                        <paragraph>Methotrexate alone or in combination with steroids was used initially for induction of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. More recently corticosteroid therapy, in combination with other antileukemic drugs or in cyclic combinations with methotrexate included, has appeared to produce rapid and effective remissions. When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in combination with 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks.  Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions.  When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days.  If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.

                        <paragraph>A variety of combination chemotherapy regimens have been used for both induction and maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The physician should be familiar with the new advances in antileukemic therapy. </paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>1.   Administration of methotrexate should be delayed until recovery if: </paragraph>

                     <item>persistent pleural effusion is present; this should be drained dry prior to infusion. </item>
                  </list>
                  <paragraph>2.   Adequate renal function must be documented. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>      a.   Serum creatinine must be normal, and creatinine clearance must be greater than 60 mL/min, before initiation of therapy. 
       
 
  <br/>      b.   Serum creatinine must be measured prior to each subsequent course of therapy.  If serum creatinine has increased by 50% or more compared to a prior value, the creatinine clearance must be measured and documented to be greater than 60 mL/min  (even if the serum creatinine is still within the normal range). 
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3.   Patients must be well hydrated, and must be treated with sodium bicarbonate for urinary alkalinization. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>      a.   Administer 1,000 mL/m<sup>2</sup> of intravenous fluid over 6 hours prior to initiation of  the methotrexate infusion.  Continue hydration at 125 mL/m<sup>2</sup>/hr (3 liters/m<sup>2</sup>/day) during the methotrexate infusion, and for 2 days after the infusion has been completed. 
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>      b.   Alkalinize urine to maintain pH above 7.0 during methotrexate infusion and leucovorin calcium therapy.  This can be accomplished by the administration of sodium bicarbonate orally or by incorporation into a separate intravenous solution. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4.   Repeat serum creatinine and serum methotrexate 24 hours after starting methotrexate and at least once daily until the methotrexate level is below 5x10<sup>-8 </sup>mol/L (0.05 micromolar). 
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.   The table below provides guidelines for leucovorin calcium dosage based upon serum methotrexate levels. (See table below.<sup>‡</sup>) 
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients who experience delayed early methotrexate elimination are likely to develop non-reversible oliguric renal failure.  In addition to appropriate leucovorin therapy, these patients require continuing hydration and urinary alkalinization, and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.  If necessary, acute, intermittent hemodialysis with a high-flux dialyzer may also be beneficial in these patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>6.   Some patients will have abnormalities in methotrexate elimination, or abnormalities in renal function following methotrexate administration, which are significant but less severe than the abnormalities described in the table below.  These abnormalities may or may not be associated with significant clinical toxicity.  If significant toxicity is observed, leucovorin rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy.  The possibility that the patient is taking other medications which interact with methotrexate (e.g., medications which may interfere with methotrexate binding to serum albumin, or elimination) should always be reconsidered when laboratory abnormalities or clinical toxicities are observed. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph> CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER LEUCOVORIN INTRATHECALLY.</paragraph>

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For either adult RA or polyarticular-course JRA, dosages may be adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response.  Limited experience shows a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression, at doses greater than 20 mg/wk in adults.  Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/wk in children, there are too few published data to assess how doses over 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/wk might affect the risk of serious toxicity in children.  Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/wk (0.65 to 1 mg/kg/wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. 
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient may continue to improve for another 12 weeks or more. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The optimal duration of therapy is unknown.  Limited data available from long-term studies in adults indicate that the initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy.  When methotrexate is discontinued, the arthritis usually worsens within 3 to 6 weeks. </paragraph>
