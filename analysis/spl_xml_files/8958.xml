                  <paragraph>The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, thermoplastic copolyolephine. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers.

                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is a synthetic antibacterial compound. Disposition of metronidazole in the body is similar for both oral and intravenous dosage forms, with an average elimination half-life in healthy humans of eight hours.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The major route of elimination of metronidazole and its metabolites is via the urine (60 to 80% of the dose), with fecal excretion accounting for 6 to 15% of the dose. The metabolites that appear in the urine result primarily from side-chain oxidation (1-[<content styleCode="italics">β</content>-hydroxyethyl]-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole and 2-methyl5-nitroimidazole-1-yl-acetic acid) and glucuronide conjugation, with unchanged metronidazole accounting for approximately 20% of the total. Renal clearance of metronidazole is approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is the major component appearing in the plasma, with lesser quantities of the 2-hydroxymethyl metabolite also being present. Less than 20% of the circulating metronidazole is bound to plasma proteins. Both the parent compound and the metabolite possess <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> bactericidal activity against most strains of anaerobic bacteria.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole appears in cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and human milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Bactericidal concentrations of metronidazole have also been detected in pus from hepatic abscesses.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Plasma concentrations of metronidazole are proportional to the administered dose. An eight-hour intravenous infusion of 100 to 4,000 mg of metronidazole in normal subjects showed a linear relationship between dose and peak plasma concentration.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients treated with metronidazole injection using a dosage regimen of 15 mg/kg loading dose followed six hours later by 7.5 mg/kg every six hours, peak steady-state plasma concentrations of metronidazole averaged 25 mcg per mL with trough (minimum) concentrations averaging 18 mcg per mL.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Decreased renal function does not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of metronidazole. However, plasma clearance of metronidazole is decreased in patients with decreased liver function.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In one study newborn infants appeared to demonstrate diminished capacity to eliminate metronidazole. The elimination half-life, measured during the first three days of life, was inversely related to gestational age. In infants whose gestational ages were between 28 and 40 weeks, the corresponding elimination half-lives ranged from 109 to 22.5 hours.

                        <paragraph>Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, exerts antibacterial effects in an anaerobic environment against most obligate anaerobes. Once metronidazole enters the organism by passive diffusion and activated in the cytoplasm of susceptible anaerobic bacteria, it is reduced; this process includes intra-cellular electron transport donors such as ferredoxin and transfer of an electron to the nitro group of the metronidazole leading to formation of a short-lived nitroso free radical. Because of this alteration of the metronidazole molecule, a concentration gradient is created and maintained which promotes the drug's intracellular transport. The reduced form of metronidazole and free radicals may interact with DNA leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis, DNA degradation, and death of bacteria. The precise mechanism of action of metronidazole is unclear.

                        <paragraph>A potential for development of resistance exists against metronidazole.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Resistance may be due to multiple mechanisms that include decreased uptake of the drug, altered reduction efficiency, overexpression of the efflux pumps, inactivation of the drug, and/or increased DNA damage repair.

                        <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Metronidazole Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (<content styleCode="italics">e.g.</content>, the common cold). When Metronidazole Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Metronidazole Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Advise patients that Metronidazole Injection may increase the risk of serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Instruct the patient to be alert for skin rash, blisters, fever or other signs and symptoms of these hypersensitivity reactions. Advise patients to stop Metronidazole Injection immediately if they develop any type of rash and seek medical attention.

                        <paragraph>Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup> ⇄NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

                        <paragraph>Metronidazole is secreted in human milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for metronidazole in mouse and rat studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
