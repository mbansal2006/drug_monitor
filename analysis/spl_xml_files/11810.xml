                        <paragraph>Pantoprazole sodium for injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also coadministered intravenously <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</content>

Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia).

                        <paragraph>Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [s<content styleCode="italics">ee Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs.  PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole sodium for injection, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 2.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The number of patients treated in comparative studies with pantoprazole sodium for injection is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with pantoprazole sodium for injection.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR)=0.55, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08-3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR=1.12 ([95% CI 0.86-1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29 [95% CI 0.84-1.97]).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at intravenous pantoprazole doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) with administration of pantoprazole sodium during organogenesis in pregnant animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and post-natal development toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development was performed with pantoprazole sodium. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5 mg/kg/day, 15 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. On postnatal day (PND 4) through PND 21, the pups were administered oral doses at 5 mg/kg/day, 15 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in humans at a dose of 40 mg). There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. During the preweaning dosing phase (PND 4 to 21) of the pups, there were increased mortality and/or moribundity and decreased body weight and body weight gain at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans receiving the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. The femur findings included lower total area, bone mineral content and density, periosteal and endosteal circumference, and cross-sectional moment of inertia. There were no microscopic changes in the distal femur, proximal tibia, or stifle joints. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period, with findings on PND 70 limited to lower femur metaphysis cortical/subcortical bone mineral density in female pups at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses.</paragraph>

Pantoprazole was detectable in milk only 2 and 4 hours after the dose with milk levels of approximately 36 mcg/L and 24 mcg/L, respectively. A milk-to-plasma ratio of 0.022 was observed at 2 hours after drug administration. Pantoprazole was not detectable (&lt;10 mcg/L) in milk at 6, 8 and 24 hours after the dose. The relative dose to the infant was estimated to be 7.3 mcg of pantoprazole, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. No adverse events in the infant were reported by the mother.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Pantoprazole sodium, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and practically insoluble in n-hexane. The reconstituted solution of pantoprazole sodium for injection is in the pH range of 9.0 to 10.5.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pantoprazole sodium for injection is supplied for intravenous administration as a white to off white colored lyophilized powder or cake in a single-dose clear glass vial fitted with a rubber stopper and crimp seal. Each vial contains 40 mg pantoprazole (equivalent to 45.1 mg of pantoprazole sodium), edetate disodium (1 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 mg to 120 mg) of pantoprazole sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 4. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. Pantoprazole sodium for injection had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 mg to 80 mg of pantoprazole sodium for injection substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of pantoprazole sodium for injection was 24 hours.</paragraph>

Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians). Although these sub-populations of slow pantoprazole metabolizers have elimination half-life values from 3.5 to 10 hours, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/*2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/*1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers. Poor metabolizers exhibited approximately 10-fold lower apparent oral clearance compared to extensive metabolizers.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with pantoprazole doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day, about 0.1 to 40 times the exposure on a body surface area basis of a 50-kg person dosed at 40 mg/day. In the gastric fundus, treatment with 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day produced enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and benign and malignant neuroendocrine cell tumors in a dose-related manner. In the forestomach, treatment with 50 and 200 mg/kg/day (about 10 and 40 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) produced benign squamous cell papillomas and malignant squamous cell carcinomas. Rare gastrointestinal tumors associated with pantoprazole treatment included an adenocarcinoma of the duodenum with 50 mg/kg/day and benign polyps and adenocarcinomas of the gastric fundus with 200 mg/kg/day. In the liver, treatment with 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day produced dose-related increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. In the thyroid gland, treatment with 200 mg/kg/day produced increased incidences of follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas for both male and female rats.</paragraph>

In the gastric fundus, treatment with 5 to 50 mg/kg/day produced enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and benign and malignant neuroendocrine cell tumors. Dose selection for this study may not have been adequate to comprehensively evaluate the carcinogenic potential of pantoprazole.</paragraph>

In the liver, treatment with 150 mg/kg/day produced increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice. Treatment with 5 to 150 mg/kg/day also produced gastric fundic ECL cell hyperplasia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of pantoprazole sodium for injection to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets to pantoprazole sodium for injection. GERD patients (n=65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 mg or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily pantoprazole sodium for injection or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 5). Also, patients on oral pantoprazole who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 5). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 5) than those treated with placebo.<br/>

After the initial 5 days, all patients were treated with 40 mg oral pantoprazole daily to complete a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Symptom relief was assessed by calculating the daily mean of the sums of the average scores for these 3 symptoms and the daily mean of the average score for each of the symptoms separately. There was no significant difference in symptom relief between pantoprazole sodium for injection and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets within the first 5 days. A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment revealed that 20 out of 23 (87%) patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection plus pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and 19 out of 22 (86%) of the patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets had endoscopically proven healing of their esophageal lesions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data comparing pantoprazole sodium for injection to other PPIs (oral or intravenous) or H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists (oral or intravenous) are limited, and therefore, are inadequate to support any conclusions regarding comparative efficacy.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 	Pathological Hypersecretion Associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two studies measured the pharmacodynamic effects of 6 day treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome (with and without multiple endocrine neoplasia type I). In one of these studies, an initial treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in 21 patients (29 to 75 years; 8 female; 4 Black, 1 Hispanic, 16 White) reduced acid output to the target level (10 mEq/h or less) and significantly reduced H<sup>+</sup> concentration and the volume of gastric secretions; target levels were achieved within 45 minutes of drug administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the other study of 14 patients (38 to 67 years; 5 female; 2 Black, 12 White) with ZE Syndrome, treatment was switched from an oral PPI to pantoprazole sodium for injection. Pantoprazole sodium for injection maintained or improved control of gastric acid secretion. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In both studies, total doses of 160 or 240 mg per day of pantoprazole sodium for injection, administered in divided doses, maintained basal acid secretion below target levels in all patients. Target levels were 10 mEq/h in patients without prior gastric surgery, and 5 mEq/h in all patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery. Once gastric acid secretion was controlled, there was no evidence of tolerance during this 7 day study. Basal acid secretion was maintained below target levels for at least 24 hours in all patients and through the end of treatment in these studies (3 to 7 days) in all but 1 patient who required a dose adjustment guided by acid output measurements until acid control was achieved. In both studies, doses were adjusted to the individual patient need, but gastric acid secretion was controlled in greater than 80% of patients by a starting regimen of 80 mg every 12 hours.</paragraph>
