Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage in all age groups throughout the course of treatment.

                        <paragraph>CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or nonmedication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and nonmedication-treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that pediatric patients who received methylphenidate for 7 days per week throughout the year had a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this development period. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, "short gut" syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel's diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the extended-release design of the tablet, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be used only in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole <content styleCode="italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (<linkHtml href="#LINK_53a1f67c-07ee-4f8c-bac6-c68a01906924">17</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions in the four placebo-controlled studies of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) leading to discontinuation occurred in 2 patients (0.6%) treated with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets including depressed mood (1, 0.3%) and headache and insomnia (1, 0.3%), and 6 placebo patients (1.9%) including headache and insomnia (1, 0.3%), irritability (2, 0.6%), headache (1, 0.3%), psychomotor hyperactivity (1, 0.3%), and tic (1, 0.3%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the two placebo-controlled studies of adults, 25 patients (6.0%) treated with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 6 placebo patients (2.8%) discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Incidence of &gt;0.5% in patients treated with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets included anxiety (1.7%), irritability (1.4%), blood pressure increased (1.0%), and nervousness (0.7%). In placebo patients, blood pressure increased and depressed mood had an incidence of &gt;0.5% (0.9%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the eleven open-label studies of pediatric patients and adults, 266 patients (7.0%) treated with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Incidence of &gt;0.5% included insomnia (1.2%), irritability (0.8%), anxiety (0.7%), decreased appetite (0.7%), and tic (0.6%).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the laboratory classroom clinical trials in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years (Studies 1 and 2), both another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and methylphenidate three times daily increased resting pulse by an average of 2 to 6 bpm and produced average increases of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of roughly 1 to 4 mm Hg during the day, relative to placebo. In the placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years (Study 4), mean increases from baseline in resting pulse rate were observed with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo at the end of the double-blind phase (5 and 3 beats/minute, respectively). Mean increases from baseline in blood pressure at the end of the double-blind phase for another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo-treated patients were 0.7 and 0.7 mm Hg (systolic) and 2.6 and 1.4 mm Hg (diastolic), respectively. In one placebo-controlled study in adults (Study 6), dose-dependent mean increases of 3.9 to 9.8 bpm from baseline in standing pulse rate were observed with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the end of the double-blind treatment vs. an increase of 2.7 beats/minute with placebo. Mean changes from baseline in standing blood pressure at the end of double-blind treatment ranged from 0.1 to 2.2 mm Hg (systolic) and -0.7 to 2.2 mm Hg (diastolic) for another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and was 1.1 mm Hg (systolic) and -1.8 mm Hg (diastolic) for placebo. In a second placebo-controlled study in adults (Study 5), mean changes from baseline in resting pulse rate were observed for another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo at the end of the double-blind treatment (3.6 and –1.6 beats/minute, respectively). Mean changes from baseline in blood pressure at the end of the double–blind treatment for another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo-treated patients were –1.2 and –0.5 mm Hg (systolic) and 1.1 and 0.4 mm Hg (diastolic), respectively <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_cb6e8cb6-d6e4-4e5d-817a-596e0c92c94e">5.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published studies and post-marketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the fetus associated with the use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants during pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">(</content>see <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Considerations). </content> </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No effects on morphological development were observed in development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats at doses up to 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 72 mg/day given to adults on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. However, malformations were observed in rabbits at a dose 54 times the MRHD given to adults. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

Methylphenidate has been shown to cause malformations in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 54 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, respectively. A reproduction study in rats revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg/day, approximately 4-fold the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited published literature, based on breast milk sampling from five mothers, reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. However, long‑term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from CNS stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse and abuse of methylphenidate may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain.

                        <paragraph>In two placebo-controlled human abuse potential studies, single oral doses of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were compared to single oral doses of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) and placebo in subjects with a history of recreational stimulant use to assess relative abuse potential. For the purpose of this assessment, the response for each of the subjective measures was defined as the maximum effect within the first 8 hours after dose administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In one study (n=40), both the other formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (108 mg, which is 1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets) and 60 mg IR MPH compared to placebo produced statistically significantly greater responses on the five subjective measures suggestive of abuse potential. In comparisons between the two active treatments, however, the other formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (108 mg) produced variable responses on positive subjective measures that were either statistically indistinguishable from (Abuse Potential, Drug Liking, Amphetamine, and Morphine Benzedrine Group [Euphoria]) or statistically less than (Stimulation – Euphoria) responses produced by 60 mg IR MPH.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In another study (n=49), both doses of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (54 mg and 108 mg) and both doses of IR MPH (50 mg and 90 mg) produced statistically significantly greater responses compared to placebo on the two primary scales used in the study (Drug Liking, Euphoria). When doses of the other methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (54 mg and 108 mg) were compared to IR MPH (50 mg and 90 mg), respectively, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets produced statistically significantly lower subjective responses on these two scales than IR MPH. Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (108 mg) produced responses that were statistically indistinguishable from the responses on these two scales produced by IR MPH (50 mg). Differences in subjective responses to the respective doses should be considered in the context that only 18% of the total amount of methylphenidate in methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets is available for immediate release from the drug overcoat.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although these findings reveal a relatively lower response to another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets on subjective measures suggestive of abuse potential compared to IR MPH at roughly equivalent total MPH doses, the relevance of these findings to the abuse potential of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the community is unknown.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets should be considered when treating patients with overdose. Because methylphenidate has a large volume of distribution and is rapidly metabolized, dialysis is not useful. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver methylphenidate hydrochloride at a controlled rate. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice on the drug-layer end of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the drug overcoat dissolves within one hour, providing an initial dose of methylphenidate. Water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core. As the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, methylphenidate is released through the orifice. The membrane controls the rate at which water enters the tablet core, which in turn controls drug delivery. Furthermore, the drug release rate from the system increases with time over a period of 6 to 7 hours due to the drug-concentration gradient incorporated into the two drug layers of core of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the stool as a tablet shell along with insoluble core components. It is possible that methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo entantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets plasma methylphenidate concentrations increase rapidly, reaching an initial maximum at about 1.5 hour, followed by gradual ascending concentrations over the next 5 to 6 hours, after which a gradual decrease begins. Mean time to reach peak plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets occurs at 5.5 hours. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with immediate-release methylphenidate three times daily. Figure 1 displays mean plasma exposures of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and methylphenidate three times daily (administered every 4 hours) in adults.</paragraph>

The mean half-life was about 3.6 hours. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were noted following single and repeated once-daily dosing, indicating no significant drug accumulation. The AUC and t<sub>1/2</sub> following repeated once-daily dosing are similar to those following the first dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a dose range of 18 mg to 144 mg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following administration methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in single doses of 18 mg, 36 mg, and 54 mg per day to healthy adults, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub> (0–inf)</sub> of d-methylphenidate were proportional to dose, whereas l-methylphenidate C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub> (0–inf)</sub> increased disproportionately with respect to dose. Following administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately 1/40 the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy adults, single and multiple dosing of once-daily methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses from 54 mg to 144 mg per day resulted in linear and dose-proportional increases in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> for total methylphenidate (MPH) and its major metabolite, α-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (PPAA). There was no time dependency in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate. The ratio of metabolite (PPAA) to parent drug (MPH) was constant across doses from 54 mg to 144 mg per day, both after single dose and upon multiple dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a multiple-dose study in ADHD with pediatric patients 13 to 16 years administered their prescribed dose (18 mg to 72 mg per day) of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>TAU</sub> of d- and total methylphenidate increased proportionally with respect to dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to PPAA, which has little or no pharmacologic activity. In adults the metabolism of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily as evaluated by metabolism to PPAA is similar to that of methylphenidate three times daily. The metabolism of single and repeated once-daily doses of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets is similar. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Increase in age resulted in increased apparent oral clearance (CL/F) (58% increase in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years compared to pediatric patients 6 to 12 years). Some of these differences could be explained by body-weight differences among these populations. This suggests that subjects with higher body weight may have lower exposures of total methylphenidate at similar doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is no experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal insufficiency. After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of PPAA. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance, renal insufficiency is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) and adult patients is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (referred to as “methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets” in the section below). The results of these adequate and well-controlled studies are presented below.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years and two double-blind placebo-controlled studies in adults who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Three double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 416 pediatric patients 6 to 12 years. The controlled studies compared methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily (18 mg, 36 mg, or 54 mg), methylphenidate given three times daily over 12 hours (15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg total daily dose), and placebo in two single-center, 3-week crossover studies (Studies 1 and 2) and in a multicenter, 4-week, parallel-group comparison (Study 3). The primary comparison of interest in all three trials was methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by community schoolteachers using the Inattention/Overactivity with Aggression (IOWA) Conners scale. Statistically significant reduction in the Inattention/Overactivity subscale versus placebo was shown consistently across all three controlled studies for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Studies 1 and 2 involved a 3-way crossover of 1 week per treatment arm. Study 3 involved 4 weeks of parallel-group treatments with a Last Observation Carried Forward analysis at Week 4. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The scores for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo for the three studies are presented in Figure 2. Error bars represent the mean plus standard error of the mean.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 4) involving 177 patients, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients aged 13 to 18 years at doses up to 72 mg once daily (1.4 mg/kg/day). Of 220 patients who entered an open 4-week titration phase, 177 were titrated to an individualized dose (maximum of 72 mg once daily) based on meeting specific improvement criteria on the ADHD Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Effectiveness with acceptable tolerability. Patients who met these criteria were then randomized to receive either their individualized dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (18 mg to 72 mg once daily, n=87) or placebo (n=90) during a two-week double-blind phase. At the end of this phase, mean scores for the investigator rating on the ADHD Rating Scale demonstrated that methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was statistically significantly superior to placebo.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 627 adults aged 18 to 65 years. The controlled studies compared methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets administered once daily and placebo in a multicenter, parallel-group, 7-week dose-titration study (Study 5) (36 mg to 108 mg once daily) and in a multicenter, parallel-group, 5-week, fixed-dose study (Study 6) (18 mg, 36 mg, and 72 mg once daily).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 5 demonstrated the effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of ADHD in adults aged 18 to 65 years at doses from 36 mg once daily to 108 mg once daily based on the change from baseline to final study visit on the Adult ADHD Investigator Rating Scale (AISRS). Of 226 patients who entered the 7-week trial, 110 were randomized to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 116 were randomized to placebo. Treatment was initiated at 36 mg once daily and patients continued with incremental increases of 18 mg once daily (36 mg to 108 mg once daily) based on meeting specific improvement criteria with acceptable tolerability. At the final study visit, mean change scores (LS Mean, SEM) for the investigator rating on the AISRS demonstrated methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was statistically significantly superior to placebo. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 6 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study (5-week duration) with 3 fixed-dose groups (18 mg, 36 mg, and 72 mg). Patients were randomized to receive methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets administered at doses of 18 mg (n=101), 36 mg (n=102), 72 mg once daily (n=102), or placebo (n=96). All three doses of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in improving CAARS (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale) total scores at double-blind end point in adult subjects with ADHD. </paragraph>
