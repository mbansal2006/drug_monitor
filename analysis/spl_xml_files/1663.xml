                        <paragraph>In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 to 80 mL/min), dalfampridine extended-release tablets plasma levels may approach those seen at a dose of 15 mg twice daily, a dose that is 1.5 times the maximum recommended dose and may be associated with an increased risk of seizures. As mild renal impairment is common after age 50, estimating CrCl is particularly important in these patients. The potential benefits of dalfampridine extended-release tablets should be carefully considered against the risk of seizures in these patients <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Dalfampridine extended-release tablets can cause seizures. Increased incidence of seizures has been observed at 20 mg twice daily (2 times the maximum recommended dosage) in controlled clinical studies of 9 to 14 weeks duration with dalfampridine in patients with MS. In open-label extension trials in MS patients, the incidence of seizures during treatment with dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily (1.7/100PY) was over 4 times higher than the incidence during treatment with 10 mg twice daily (0.4/100PY). In the postmarketing period seizures have been reported. The majority of seizures occurred at the recommended dose and in patients without a history of seizures, and generally within days to weeks of starting therapy.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Dalfampridine extended-release tablets have not been evaluated in patients with a history of seizures or with evidence of epileptiform activity on an EEG, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of seizures in patients with epileptiform activity on an EEG is unknown, and could be substantially higher than that observed in dalfampridine extended-release tablets clinical studies. Permanently discontinue dalfampridine extended-release tablets in patients who have experience a seizure while on treatment. Dalfampridine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures <content styleCode="italics">[see  Contraindications (4)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Dalfampridine extended-release tablets can cause anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions. Signs and symptoms have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Dalfampridine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to discontinue dalfampridine extended-release tablets and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks duration, 4% (15/400) of patients treated with dalfampridine extended-release tablets 10 mg twice daily experienced one or more adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, compared to 2% (5/238) of placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of at least 2 patients treated with dalfampridine extended-release tablets and that led to discontinuation more frequently compared to placebo were headache (dalfampridine extended-release tablets 0.5%, placebo 0%), balance disorder (dalfampridine extended-release tablets 0.5%, placebo 0%), dizziness (dalfampridine extended-release tablets 0.5%, placebo 0%), and confusional state (dalfampridine extended-release tablets 0.3%, placebo 0%).</paragraph>

                           <content>Dalfampridine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in a total of 1,952 subjects, including 917 MS patients. A total of 741 patients have been treated with dalfampridine extended-release tablets for over six months, 501 for over one year and 352 for over two years. The experience in open-label clinical trials is consistent with the safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. As in controlled clinical trials, a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of seizures has been observed in open-label clinical trials with dalfampridine extended-release tablets in patients with MS as follows: Dalfampridine extended-release tablets 10 mg twice daily 0.41 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.96); dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily 1.7 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 6.28).</content>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Three cases of overdose were reported in controlled clinical trials with dalfampridine extended-release tablets, involving two MS patients. The first patient took six times the currently recommended dose (60 mg) and was taken to the emergency room with altered mental state. The second patient took 40 mg doses on two separate occasions. In the first instance, she experienced a complex partial seizure and, in the second instance, a period of confusion. Both patients recovered by the following day without sequelae. <br/>
                     <br/> Several cases of overdose are found in the scientific literature in which various formulations of dalfampridine were used, resulting in numerous adverse events including seizure, confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, and amnesia. In some instances, patients developed status epilepticus, requiring intensive supportive care and were responsive to standard therapy for seizures. In one published case report, an MS patient who ingested 300 mg of 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) developed a condition that resembled limbic encephalitis. This patient developed weakness, reduced awareness, memory loss, hypophonic speech, and temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI. The patient’s speech and language and ambulation improved over time, and an MRI at 4 months after the overdose no longer showed signal abnormalities. At one year, the patient continued to have difficulty with short term memory and learning new tasks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated. Dalfampridine is a broad spectrum potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of action potentials in demyelinated axons through inhibition of potassium channels.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Orally administered dalfampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Absolute bioavailability of dalfampridine extended-release tablets have not been assessed, but relative bioavailability is 96% when compared to an aqueous oral solution. The extended-release tablet delays absorption of dalfampridine relative to the solution formulation, giving a slower rise to a lower peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), with no effect on the extent of absorption (AUC). Single dalfampridine extended-release tablet 10 mg doses administered to healthy volunteers in a fasted state gave peak concentrations ranging from 17.3 ng/mL to 21.6 ng/mL occurring 3 to 4 hours post-administration (T<sub>max</sub>). In comparison, C<sub>max</sub> with the same 10 mg dose of dalfampridine in an oral solution was 42.7 ng/mL and occurred approximately 1.3 hours after dosing. Exposure increased proportionally with dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dalfampridine is largely unbound to plasma proteins (97 to 99%). The apparent volume of distribution is 2.6 L/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no apparent difference in pharmacokinetic parameter values following administration of dalfampridine extended-release tablets to either healthy volunteers or patients with MS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When dalfampridine is taken with food, there is a slight increase in C<sub>max</sub> (12 to 17%) and a slight decrease in AUC (4 to 7%). These changes in exposure are not clinically significant, and therefore the drug may be taken with or without food <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Dalfampridine and metabolites elimination is nearly complete after 24 hours, with 95.9% of the dose recovered in urine and 0.5% recovered in feces. Most of the excreted radioactivity in urine was parent drug (90.3%). Two metabolites were identified: 3-hydroxy­-4-aminopyridine (4.3%) and 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate (2.6%). These metabolites have been shown to have no pharmacologic activity on potassium channels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The apparent elimination half-life of dalfampridine following administration of the dalfampridine extended-release tablets is 5.2 to 6.5 hours. The plasma half-life of the sulfate conjugate is approximately 7.6 hours and the half-life of 3-hydroxy-4­-aminopyridine could not be calculated because concentrations for most subjects were close to or below the limit of quantitation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that CYP2E1 was the major enzyme responsible for the 3-hydroxylation of dalfampridine. The identity of the CYP enzymes suspected of playing a minor role in the 3-hydroxylation of dalfampridine could not be established unequivocally.<br/>

A total of 283 patients (212 dalfampridine extended-release tablets and 71 placebo) completed all study visits. Patient inclusion criteria included the ability to walk 25 feet in 8 to 45 seconds. Patient exclusion criteria included a history of seizures or evidence of epileptiform activity on a screening EEG, and onset of an MS exacerbation within 60 days.<br/>

                  <paragraph>During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking dalfampridine extended-release tablets 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo (Figure 1 and Figure 2).</paragraph>

                     <br/> In Trial 1 and Trial 2, consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug-placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>The majority of patients in these trials (63%) were using immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab), but the magnitude of improvement in walking ability was independent of concomitant treatment with these drugs. No differences in effectiveness based on degree of impairment, age, gender, or body mass index were detected. There were too few non-Caucasians in the patient population to evaluate the effect of race.</paragraph>
